Top NATO Scientist With Security Clearance Busted Spying for ChinaThe Italian, who was the captain of a navy frigate, was taken into custody on charges of espionage and endangering state security.  The Russian, who has diplomatic status, was released to the Russian embassy in Rome and will be expelled from the country.  On Tuesday, Italy’s foreign ministry summoned Russian ambassador Sergey Razov to get to the bottom of the matter.  The foreign minister’s office later announced that Italy had expelled two Russian diplomats tied to the arrest, but did not elaborate who the second Russian was or what role he or she may have played.  The Russian embassy in Rome confirmed the events and released a short statement, saying it was “verifying” details, and hoped the inconvenient series of events would not compromise relations between the two nations.  “For now, we consider it inappropriate to comment on what happened,” the statement said.  “In any event, we hope that what happened is not reflected on the bilateral relationship between Russia and Italy. ”Russian president Vladimir Putin’s obsession with the destruction of NATO, which was to a large extent backed by former President Donald Trump, is not yet confirmed as the motive behind the sale of these documents.  There are six NATO bases in Italy, all joint operations with the U. S.  and Italian military.  It is yet unknown which of those bases the alleged Italian spy worked on. NATO officials did not immediately return requests for information, but this is the second event involving classified NATO documents in recent weeks.  In mid March, an Estonian researcher with NATO clearance was arrested for spying for China.  Top NATO Scientist With Security Clearance Busted Spying for ChinaThe two had been under surveillance for more than two months in an investigation led by Italian secret service chief Mario Parente.  They were arrested as they passed the dossier for a wad of cash, according to local media based on unnamed sources.  Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

2021-03-30 19:08:07#tech#CD Projekt has 'decided to reconsider' Cyberpunk 2077’s multiplayer#https://www.pcgamer.com/cd-projekt-has-decided-to-reconsider-cyberpunk-2077s-multiplayer/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yx4SMhV5qJ4yPpfo3Pewvm-1200-80.jpg#en#0.0#www.pcgamer.com#"In a strategy update video released today, CD Projekt said that it has ""decided to reconsider"" its plans for Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer.  As part of a broader move toward a more ""agile"" approach to development, the studio is shifting its focus to bringing online elements to all its games ""where they make sense. ""The exact nature of Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer has never really been nailed down, but it was expected to be something big, possibly akin to GTA Online.  In a November 2020 earnings call transcribed by Seeking Alpha, CD Projekt joint CEO Adam Kiciński described it as ""a separate dedicated production"" that developers consider  ""a standalone product. ""Obviously, it's not entirely standalone as it comes from the universe of Cyberpunk and is very much related to the concept of single player Cyberpunk we—I came up with,"" he said at the time.  ""But from our perspective, it's—is another independent production and independent team of people works on it. ""Now, however, it sounds like that plan has been scrapped.  After discussing how CD Projekt plans to change its approach to game development going forward, Kiciński said the studio has decided to take a different approach to multiplayer—and not just in Cyberpunk. ""Previously we hinted that our next triple-A would be a multiplayer Cyberpunk game, but we have decided to reconsider this plan,"" Kiciński says in the video.  ""Given our new, more systematic and agile approach, instead of primarily focusing on one big online experience or game, we are focusing on bringing online into all of our franchises one day.  We are building an online technology that can be seamlessly integrated into development of our future games. ""Details are naturally short at this point, but Kiciński said that GOG Galaxy, CD Projekt's multi-storefront launcher, will play a central role in the effort to ""grow a global community of gamers. "" At the same time, he emphasized that this new approach should not be taken as a sign that CD Projekt is moving away from the style of games it's known for. ""CD Projekt Red makes singleplayer, story-driven, triple-A RPGs.  That is not changing,"" he said.  ""What is changing is our long-term approach to online.  By this, we mean ensuring we are properly prepared to implement online elements in our games where they make sense.  We don't have to go overboard, or lose our singleplayer DNA.  We want to take thoughtful steps to build robust online capabilities. ""Presumably as part of that process, CD Projekt also announced today that it has acquired Digital Scapes, a Canadian studio that specializes in multiplayer game development.  Digital Scapes, which has been renamed to CD Projekt Red Vancouver, has been working on Cyberpunk 2077 since October 2018, and while there's no information yet on how the studio's role will change now that it's officially part of the family, it would seem to be a natural fit for CD Projekt's expanded multiplayer plans. CD Projekt's strategy update video touches a number of other topics, including greater integration of development teams, shorter marketing campaigns, and most importantly, an increased focus on the health and wellbeing of the development team.  It's also expanding development capacity ""to enable parallel triple-a game development,"" which could be a hint of good news for Witcher fans crossing their fingers for a new game. I've reached out to CD Projekt to inquire about its revised plans for Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer, and will update if I receive a reply.

It's courtesy of an optional feature of PCI Express that allows the CPU to more efficiently access your graphics card's VRAM. The feature was originally only turned on for the RTX 3060 and the growing range of laptops that use its Ampere graphics technology, but now all of Nvidia's Ampere cards get the same level of PCIe love.  Nvidia has done its bit, but there are plenty of other elements that need to be bang up-to-date for Resizable BAR to work, including a compatible CPU and motherboard.  You'll also need to update your motherboard BIOS as well as flash your graphics card's VBIOS to get it working.  Finally, you'll need to update to the very latest Game Ready Driver driver. Got all that? Then you're in a great position to claim all your free extra frames.  And there are some decent improvements to be had, with F1 2020 pulling out ahead with an 11. 9 percent improvement and Cyberpunk 2077 bring up the rear at a 5. 9 percent boost.  Hardly earth-shattering improvements, but hey, it's free, so you may as well. #https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidias-latest-graphics-cards-get-a-free-speed-boost-today-in-exactly-17-games/#uPTbyfp8d

The murder of Sarah Everard, 33, sparked a huge outpouring of grief and dismay in Britain at the failure of police and wider society to tackle violence against women.  At a vigil in her memory, which police said broke COVID-19 lockdown rules, officers faced accusations of acting with undue force after a number of women were pinned down and then dragged away in handcuffs after the crowd refused orders to disperse. #https://news.yahoo.com/london-police-acted-appropriately-over-102621591.html#JXbqBgwrU

The approval, given to a licensed version of the drug made by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and exported to dozens of countries, could help health authorities minimise vaccine wastage and better plan their inoculation programmes.  Some African countries have only until the middle of next month to use up more than a million doses of the vaccine - branded Covishield by SII - if the shelf life is not extended. #https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-india-extends-shelf-life-104935070.html#h0oIjLiuQ

When blame gets assigned, it will likely lead to years of litigation to recoup the costs of repairing the ship, fixing the canal and reimbursing those who saw their cargo shipments disrupted.  Since the vessel is owned by a Japanese firm, operated by a Taiwanese shipper, flagged in Panama and now stuck in Egypt, matters quickly become an international morass. #https://www.yahoo.com/news/probe-underway-day-cargo-ship-060141759.html#BkX41rdcs

What Happened: The lawsuit was filed by the Illinois Automobile Dealers Association, the Chicago Automobile Trade Association, and other plaintiffs including individual franchised auto dealers in the state.  The plaintiffs allege that Amazon. com Inc.  (NASDAQ: AMZN)-backed electric truck startup Rivian, California-based EV startup Lucid Motors and the state of Illinois are violating state laws that require new vehicles to be sold through franchised dealers.  It accuses the Secretary of State’s office of “turning a blind eye to Rivian’s unlicensed sales operations” in violation of state law.  Lucid Motors plans to go public via a SPAC merger with blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp.  IV (NYSE: CCIV).  The company is on track to deliver its Air luxury vehicle later this year and is focusing on a direct-to-consumer model by opening new showrooms called “Lucid Studios. ” Lucid plans to open a showroom in Oak Brook, Illinois, in the second quarter of 2021.  Rivian has said it plans to begin delivering its R1T electric pickup truck in June and its R1S electric SUV in August this year.  The company manufactures its flagship EVs at its plant in Normal, Illinois.  The company is constructing a showroom in Chicago.  See Also: Lucid Says The High-End Version Of Its Air Sedan Is Already Sold Out Why It Matters: Illinois auto dealers have previously too expressed their concern over direct sales and challenged Tesla Inc.  (NASDAQ: TSLA) for its direct-to-consumer sales model.  In May 2019, the auto dealers, the Secretary of State and Tesla entered into an administrative consent order agreeing that Tesla could have no more than 13 dealer licenses in Illinois, as per the lawsuit.  Nevertheless, other automakers are increasingly following Tesla’s lead by adopting the direct sales model.  It was reported in February that Lordstown Motors Corp.  (NASDAQ: RIDE) is looking to sell its trucks directly to customers in Ohio.  Ohio allowed Tesla to make direct sales to its customers in 2014.

As discovered by Reddit user PerhapsUnexpected, it appears that save files in Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix are stored inside a single PNG image.  Seriously!The internet sleuths found the strange 7MB image while digging through the files of the recently released Kingdom Hearts HD 1. 5+2. 5 ReMIX PC port.  They were probably expecting to find a typical save file format like a . txt, but all they could find were two PNG images—one with Mickey Mouse ears called System Data and another with Sora's face called Save Data.  Confused, they tried opening the Sora image with a hex editor and found what appears to be their save data embedded inside the PNG's metadata.

But Ninja Gaiden Black, regarded by many as the best in the series, is a notable absence. In an interview with Polygon, producer Fumihiko Yasuda revealed that one of the reasons Ninja Gaiden Black isn't anywhere to be seen is because a lot of the earlier Ninja Gaiden games weren't preserved, and have since been lost to the ether. ""The data we have left from Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden 2 are in various pieces to the point that we were unable to salvage them,"" Yasuda said.  ""However, when we worked on Sigma and Sigma 2, we went and collected as much of that data as possible and organised it.  And since we could utilise this data, that's why we chose the Sigma games. ""Yasuda also essentially confirmed that the remastered Sigma 2 will stick with its purple smoke 'blood' instead of returning to the original Ninja Gaiden 2's anarchic limbs-a-flyin' bloodfest, saying ""the content will be similar to the original Sigma, Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge games. ""The Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection hits Steam on June 10.  The collection will run at 60 fps and in 4K on PC, but sadly will see the removal of online mode almost entirely.  Tag Missions are returning, but in a single-player format with ""some of the unreasonably difficult parts"" adjusted to compensate.

Disco Elysium's expanded Final Cut edition, which went on sale today, was planned to have a physical release and so had to go before the board, where it was refused classification.  Though Disco Elysium's portrayal of drug addiction is hardly a glowing advertisement, taking speed does give a +1 to your Motorics and Psyche stats.  According to the Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games ""illicit or proscribed drug use related to incentives or rewards"" means a game is automatically refused classification and selling, distributing, publicly exhibiting, advertising, or importing it into Australia becomes a criminal offense. Previously, games that fell afoul of the same rule like Wasteland 3 and Fallout 3 were altered to either remove similar interactions or more blatantly fictionalize their drugs.  Disco Elysium was not, which is why it's a surprise to see Disco Elysium: The Final Cut on sale in Australia on Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store—though it hasn't shown up on the PlayStation Store here and presumably won't.  Anyone who already owns Disco Elysium receives the Final Cut as a free update, and we were expecting that to sneak past (it has, I just fired it up, loaded an old save, and was immediately abused by a fully voiced Cuno).  But we weren't expecting it to remain on sale, given that Hotline Miami 2 for instance, still can't be purchased here. However, other games that were refused classification in Australia like Katana Zero, Mother Russia Bleeds, and Super Blood Hockey have remained available on multiple digital storefronts.  Perhaps Disco Elysium will join them in quietly persisting, or perhaps it'll disappear.  Probably best to grab a copy now, just in case.

In that time, Google has brought a stable method to deliver a plethora of Linux applications to the Chrome operating system without the need for hacky workarounds that compromise the integrity and security of the platform.  Crostini, a. k. a.  Linux apps on Chrome OS, isn't perfect and there are still some pieces missing to make the experience 100% viable but there's no question that it has added to the overall value of the Chrome OS ecosystem.  I personally believe that the Chrome OS team has stumbled upon what could be the future of computing that could leverage containers and Plugin VMs to give users access to any software they need all through the portal that is Chrome OS. #https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-uninstall-linux-apps-from-your-chromebook/#1Cwvz1sJx

Why it matters: New spacecraft recently sent to Mars will help NASA and other space agencies fill in gaps in knowledge, moving them ever-closer to finding out whether the world once played host to life. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets.  Subscribe for free. But answering questions about Mars' past and its potential for life will likely take more spacecraft, and possibly even human missions to solve. Driving the news: A study published this month suggests much of Mars' water may have been absorbed into the ground, not lost to space, as scientists have thought for decades. Thanks to this new study, scientists have been able to start to square the planet's geology with what they know of how its atmosphere was lost, painting a clearer picture of why the world is now the barren one we see today. Yes, but: Not all questions about Mars can be quickly answered with current data. Perhaps the most pressing question has stood for centuries: Has life ever existed on the Red Planet? NASA is just scratching the surface of answering that question using its Perseverance rover — the first mission dedicated to hunting for past Martian life — which made it to Mars in February.  Even that rover likely won't be able to find signs of life on its own, however.  Perseverance is expected to cache samples for a return to Earth on a future mission that will allow scientists to use high-powered tools to analyze the samples. The big questions: Although scientists know Mars was once habitable — at least for microbial life — it's still not clear that the environment could have supported diverse and abundant life as we see on Earth.  While the planet did have lakes and rivers, researchers don't know exactly how warm the planet was. ""There are a lot of basic things we still don't know, like how warm or how wet was ancient Mars? Was it a cold, icy barren world or was it this warmer, wetter . . .  warm desert planet?"" Purdue University planetary scientist Briony Horgan told me. Rovers on the planet have also found the world is scattered with layered rocks, but no one is quite sure how they formed.  Scientists' best guess at the moment is these layers formed through erosion, wind, water and ice.  But we don't see rock layers like this on Earth because they're destroyed by plate tectonics, which don't exist on Mars, Horgan added.  The intrigue: Sending rovers and landers to Mars has actually complicated scientists' understanding of the Red Planet. ""When you only have one data point, it's easy to make a model that fits that one data point, but when you have 50 data points, it's a lot harder to find the right model to fit those data,"" NASA Mars researcher Abigail Fraeman told me. What's next: Human missions to the Red Planet could one day help resolve these mismatches between data beamed back from spacecraft in orbit and rover-collected data from the ground.  Having people on Mars would allow scientists to easily move to other parts of the planet to search for interesting rocks without the planning and guesswork that goes into a rover's roadmap, experts say.

U. S.  index futures weakened as traders assessed the fallout from the implosion of Archegos Capital Management. Europe’s equity benchmark extended its highest level in 13 months as the momentum swung in favor of cyclical stocks such as banks and automakers.  The dollar rose for a second day and gold slipped below $1,700 per troy ounce.  Oil halted a two-day rally before the April 1 meeting of OPEC and its allies. “U. S.  yields will quickly grab significant attention and likely weigh on risk sentiment if we see a significant new advance higher on Treasury market weakness,” Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank, wrote in a note.  “Biden’s speech might be catalyst for a deeper selloff. ”Biden, in an address Wednesday in Pittsburgh, will detail a mass expansion of government spending aimed at reducing inequality and strengthening infrastructure.  A revamp of the tax code is also part of the plan and is already proving divisive among economists and lawmakers. Ten-year Treasury yields increased to 1. 76%.  The five-year rate rose as high as 0. 95%, a 13-month high, followed by a block sale in the notes.  The U. S.  reached a record three-day stretch of 10 million shots over the weekend, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker, and plans to offer inoculations to 90% of adults. ViacomCBS climbed in premarket trading in New York.  Discovery Inc.  and the American Depositary Receipts of Chinese companies linked to the Archegos block trades also posted gains.  Tesla Inc.  fell after a report Xiaomi Corp.  plans to invest $15 billion to make electric cars. Investors have been focusing on the strength of the recovery and inflation risks as governments step up spending to spur growth.  Positive news on vaccines is helping risk appetite, with a real-world study from Pfizer Inc.  and Moderna Inc.  showing their doses effectively prevented coronavirus infections, U. S.  government researchers said. Read: Archegos Drama Hardly Ruffles a Market That’s ‘Drunk on Risk’Some key events to watch this week:President Biden is expected to unveil his infrastructure program Wednesday. EIA crude inventory report Wednesday. OPEC+ meets to discuss production levels for May on Thursday. China Caixin PMI due Thursday. U. S.  employment report for March on Friday. Good Friday starts the Easter weekend in countries including the U. S. , U. K. , France, Germany, Australia and Canada. These are some of the main moves in financial markets:StocksFutures on the S&P 500 Index dipped 0. 3% as of 8:19 a. m.  New York time. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0. 3%. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index decreased 0. 1%. The MSCI Emerging Market Index rose 0. 5%. CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index jumped 0. 2%. The euro declined 0. 2% to $1. 1741. The British pound dipped 0. 1% to $1. 3751. The onshore yuan was little changed at 6. 571 per dollar. The Japanese yen weakened 0. 4% to 110. 28 per dollar. BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries gained four basis points to 1. 75%. The yield on two-year Treasuries gained one basis point to 0. 15%. Germany’s 10-year yield climbed five basis points to -0. 27%. Britain’s 10-year yield gained five basis points to 0. 84%. Japan’s 10-year yield rose two basis points to 0. 091%.

The show’s third season just ended last week, wrapping things up in such a way that seemed to imply that one final season would at least be a possibility, but no, this is the end for the troubled Neil Gaiman adaptation—or is it? Yes, as is the case with everything involving American Gods, this isn’t totally straightforward.  According to Deadline, the show has been canceled and Starz will not be ordering a fourth season, buuut there are apparently “discussions” going on about giving the show a proper send-off with a TV movie or event series. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/starz-excommunicates-american-gods-may-024500573.html#gwLmJ3gaT
