The IRS says it needs more time to reprogram its computers based on the COVID Relief Act which wasn’t signed into law until the end of December. #https://komonews.com/news/consumer/irs-delays-start-of-tax-filing-season#aLdKyEGav

For all the transformation still undergoing Fortnite, 2017 feels like too small a distance for a game to have gone from rumored vaporware to global phenomenon.  I scored the earliest version of Fortnite a 55 at the time, a clearly troubled project that Epic Games just needed to get out after spinning its wheels in development purgatory.  Fortnite would either take on new life in the hands of players or fizzle out and die of natural causes.  It happens.  But just as the battle royale craze spun up in the wake of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' surprise success, Epic pulled an historic U-turn and put out Fortnite: Battle Royale, then a simple spin-off developed in three months.  Over time Fortnite's improvisational development helped establish a modern vocabulary for live games with in-game events, battle passes, and consistent seasonal cycles.  Fortnite saw the rise of Ninja and mainstream Twitch celebrity at large, it saw Epic try out bonkers marketing stunts like the complete shutdown of Fortnite for a few days just to generate awareness and usher in Chapter 2.  Fortnite became such a cultural, money-printing force that Epic went as far as to abandon the iOS platform as a form of protest over ""monopolistic practices,"" even accompanying the move with a parody of Apple's own 1984-inspired Macintosh ad.  And now, in 2021, Fortnite is still trucking along, still making stuff up on the fly, but it's settled into a more comfortable rhythm.  Fortnite is a battle royale toy box without a bottom, and with every recognizable character and brand waiting for their turn in the item shop.  Even if you've played before, look away for a second and Fortnite will take on a totally new look when you turn back.  So let's take a look at the state of Fortnite in 2021 and try to guess how this megagame might transform further. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-fortnite-in-2021/#SDAkTnn1r

The Schitt's Creek star shared her plans to sell the dress to the highest bidder on Jan.  21, and noted that 100 percent of proceeds will go to charity.  ""This was the very first thing I wore on my very first red carpet (the Canadian Screen Awards in 2015) so yeah, there might be anxiety sweat in the armpits, but there are pockets in the dress, so it balances out,"" she captioned an Instagram post.  ""I would very much like to sell it to you if you're in the market. "" The proceeds from the dress will be evenly split between two charities, including Encampment Support Network, a volunteer-run network that helps individuals living in tent encampments across Toronto.  Murphy will enlist the help of her followers to choose the second charity (Canadian or American) to support.  As a seasoned trend setter, Murphy knows that we shop with our eyes, but she threw in a few key details about the dress to make it even more appealing to potential bidders.  Highlights of the elegant gown include: ""It's black. "" ""It has pockets. "" ""It's made by evening wear brand Wayne Clark Designs. "" ""It is sweaty in and around the armpit area. "" ""It's a size 4. "" ""There's a big ol 'v' in the front so your skin can pop out of there. "" ""It's very nice. "" Interested in expanding your wardrobe to reflect a little more of the true style icon behind Alexis Rose? Anyone willing to donate a sizeable amount to charity can email Murphy at csadress69@gmail. com.  She'll only respond to the highest bidders, so this might be the time to gather up the gang and have everyone chip in on the most squeal-worthy of dresses, as Alexis might say.  Take a closer look at Murphy's evening gown from the 2015 Canadian Screen Awards here.

The Inquisitor stabs a knife directly into a map of the Tevinter Imperium at the end of the Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC Trespasser, for one thing, and BioWare pointed a finger in the same direction in 2020 with the release of a collection of short stories called Tevinter Nights. The writing's been on the wall.  But now, it's in an actual licensed book.  Any doubts about the location of the new game have been dispelled by the recently released BioWare: Stories and Secrets from 25 Years of Game Development, a book celebrating the studio's 25th anniversary with art, pictures, commentary, and stories.  Tom Phillips of Eurogamer scored himself a copy, and found an official confirmation inside. ""As BioWare entered its twenty-fifth year, the Dragon Age team was hard at work on Morrison, the code name of the long-awaited follow-up to Dragon Age: Inquisition,"" an entry on page 324 called ""Tevinter Bound: A sneak peek at the follow-up to Inquisition"" states.

They’re paying up for bullish derivatives tracking the Chinese internet firm, buying thousands of January call options that expire Thursday.  The price of one Tencent contract -- which bets the stock will rise past HK$800 by expiry -- surged as much as 118,300% on Monday.  Traders also rushed to offload their bearish puts, with one of the most-traded contracts losing more than 84% in value. The stock rallied 11% on Monday to HK$766. 50, its biggest gain since October 2011.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index benchmark rose 2. 4%, closing above the key 30,000 point-level for the first time since May 2019. Tencent has become a prime target for mainland traders flooding record amounts of cash into Hong Kong-listed shares this year, with net purchase of the stock accounting for roughly a quarter of total money coming in, according to exchange data.  The buying frenzy has also boosted Tencent’s market value by about $251 billion this year, the most worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tesla Inc.  is the second-largest gainer, up $134 billion. Tencent shares now trade at nearly 40 times analysts’ estimated earnings for the next 12 months.  While that’s well above the average of 30 since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2005, it’s still below the recent peak multiple of 42 reached in 2014 and 2018.  It reached 65 at the height of China’s equity bubble in 2007. On Monday, analysts at Citigroup Inc.  lifted their target price on the firm by 19% to HK$876, the highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, citing the company’s market-share expansion and growth in the gaming sector and other digital businesses. Tencent is also getting an additional boost from taking part in the city’s fast-growing initial public offering market.  Kuaishou Technology, backed by Tencent, is seeking to raise as much as $5. 4 billion in Hong Kong in what would be the biggest internet IPO since Uber Technologies Inc. With the recent run-up, Tencent is trading at its highest price on record.  It’s largely avoided the tightening regulatory oversight that sparked a selloff in rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and forced its part-owned Ant Group Co.  to jettison a record IPO.

The secret? Run forward and shoot your gun. Speedrunner Wreak finished the level in 9 seconds on January 22nd, followed by Der_Lauch_Linus on the 23rd.  The speedy completion is due to the level's funky architecture.  The Dubai level takes place on the top floors of a skyscraper, and in the moments after the start of the level both targets are visible on balconies above Agent 47's starting point.  So you move quick, aim well, and shoot them both in seconds.  You can watch Wreak's record run here and Der_Lauch_Linus' record here.  Bonus points to Wreak for wearing a sillier costume than Linus.  These are Any% runs, which means that they simply have to complete the objectives by Speedrun. com's rules. It's not clear if you can do it in 8 seconds.  There are crucial milliseconds where Wreak or Linus are lining up their shots.  I'll bet you someone is already trying.  Meanwhile, the Silent Assassin run record is only a measly 7 seconds longer. #https://www.pcgamer.com/the-hitman-3-dubai-speedrun-record-9-seconds/#QkvPEvOyy

They added that one of the issues discussed was Iran.  * In recent days, Sullivan made calls to his counterparts in the U.

The big picture: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned about President Biden's stated goal of trying to resume the nuclear deal with Iran.  Such a move could result in tensions between the Biden administration and the Israeli government.  * Secretary of State designate Tony Blinken said at his confirmation hearing this week that ""there is a long way"" until the Iran deal could be resumed.  * He stressed that the U.

Gavin Newsom last week suddenly added the 4 million residents between ages 65 and 74 to what was supposed to be a shorter list of people first in line for shots, including health care workers and those in nursing care facilities.  Adding to the confusion is a hodgepodge of systems and differing requirements in the state's 58 counties.  For example, Los Angeles and Orange counties authorized mass vaccination sites like Dodger Stadium and Disneyland to give shots to those over 65, while San Francisco is relying largely on hospital systems to vaccinate only patients 75 and up.  Some counties are vaccinating first responders, grocery clerks and farm workers, while others are finishing up health care workers before moving to other groups.  The variety of approaches invariably means, for example, envious seniors in one part of the state are left wondering when it’s their turn as they see video of others getting shots.  Those include 73-year-old former Gov.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, who touted his inoculation at Dodger Stadium this week with a famous line from his Terminator films: “Come with me if you want to live. ” Another senior citizen, Oakland resident Sam Burd, had a frustrating week trying to get shots for himself and his wife.  He had noticed long lines snaking outside the nonprofit Asian Health Services and ran into a neighbor on Wednesday who said she had received vaccine there.  He asked for the. . . #https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Hodgepodge-systems-confusion-mar-California-15892717.php#noMhsia6Z

China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, the developer's Hong Kong-listed unit, is raising HK$26 billion (US$3. 35 billion) selling 952. 4 million new shares at HK$27. 30 each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday.  The price represents a 9 per cent discount to the last traded level on Friday, and the stake amounts to about 9. 75 per cent of its enlarged capital. Some of the richest Hong Kong and mainland tycoons have agreed to subscribe for the shares, the company said.  They include Chan Hoi-wan of developer Chinese Estate Holdings and spouse of Joseph Lau Luen-hung, as well as Liu Ming-hui, the founder of China Gas Holdings.  Each will buy HK$3 billion of stake.  The buyers have agreed to a 12-month lock-up on their shares. Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China. The stock placement shows the investors' confidence in the business prospects and can also strengthen its capital base, according to the company's filing.  It will help the Group's strategic goal of becoming ""the world's largest and most powerful new energy vehicle group,"" it added. Chinese EV makers like NIO, Xpeng, and Li Auto are rushing to catch an expected upswing in demand as China's economic rebound gains traction after growth quickened to a pre-pandemic pace of more than 6 per cent last quarter.  China is also set to become the world's biggest market for EV when 4 million cars, or one in every five vehicles, will be powered by electricity by 2025. The race to the market is preceded by a rush to build a war chest of capital.  China Evergrande NEV earlier sold 176. 6 million of new shares in September for about HK$4 billion, or HK$22. 65 each.  Earlier this month, NIO raised about US$1. 3 billion from the sale of convertible bonds, while Xpeng got US$1. 98 billion of credit lines from five mainland banking groups.  Last week, BYD announced a stock placement to raise US$3. 9 billon. China Evergrande NEV is controlled by the country's third richest tycoon Hui Ka-yan.  His plan is to raise its car production capacity to 500,000 to 1 million vehicles within three to five years, the company said on its website.  Its plants in Shanghai and Guangzhou will be capable of rolling out 200,000 units a year each at the beginning, before reaching 1 million by the fifth year, it added. The company's shares have risen 307 per cent over the past 12 months, giving it a market value of about US$34 billion despite incurring huge losses over the past two years.  The other four investors who have agreed to take up HK$5 billion each in the stock placement include businessmen from its home base Shenzhen. China Evergrande NEV intends to spend the money on technology research and development, production of new energy vehicle business and repay older debt, it said in the filing.

Dining in a restaurant might involve a tent and heat lamps, doctors appointments are conducted via telemedicine apps, and gone are the days of meandering your way through a mall.  Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has one more addition to the growing list of lifestyle changes: Staring Tuesday, you'll be required to provide evidence of a negative COVID test before flying back to the U. S.  from any international destination. ""If you plan to travel internationally, you will need to get tested no more than 3 days before you travel by air into the United States (US) and show your negative result to the airline before you board your flight, or be prepared to show documentation of recovery,"" reads the new policy, which was posted to the CDC's website on Jan.  23. As the new policy mandates, airlines must refuse to board anyone who fails to provide a negative COVID test result.  This could very well disrupt travel plans for some, but should help to minimize potential exposure for those flying, as well as the broader public. According to David Cutler, MD, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, the CDC's new policy has arrived not a moment too soon.  As he explains, the ""recently increased ability of COVID to pass from person to person is making air travel and all activities more risky for contracting this disease. ""Longer flights already pose a risk that experts say is incalculable at this time.  Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), said in a recent interview that shorter flights may be safe due to HEPA filter use for ""modest duration flights,"" but for long, international flights, ""all bets are off. ""It is impossible to say how safe airline travel might be,"" agrees Cutler.  ""It is important to recognize that anyone around you could transmit COVID to you.  And you could pass it on to others. ""If you must fly, read on for some expert-approved tips on how to do it as safely as possible.  And for the masks you shouldn't wear while flying or in any other situation, check out The CDC Warns Against Using These 6 Face Masks.  1 Skip the flight if you have symptoms.  Just because you get a negative test doesn't necessarily mean you're in the clear.  If you present with any of the typical COVID symptoms, you should seriously consider postponing your flight—even if your test has not confirmed your case. According to the MD Anderson Center at the University of Texas, rapid antigen tests are less accurate than PCR tests at spotting the virus.  And while the CDC doesn't require any particular test type, the three-day window will mean most travelers will use rapid tests, which can deliver results in as little as a half an hour, rather than the two to five days that it takes to get PCR test results. ""To a certain degree, you're sacrificing accuracy with speed.  By their very nature, the antigen style tests aren't as sensitive because they require a larger amount of virus present to be positive,"" explains the MD Anderson website.  ""Someone with a positive test by this style of test should be treated as infected with COVID-19, but a negative test is less reliable and may need to be confirmed. "" And for more regular COVID updates, sign up for our daily newsletter.  2 Be vigilant before you board.  According to Cutler, the risk of flying isn't limited to your flight time.  ""The risk of air travel also includes the risks of transport to the airport,"" along with the time spent navigating airport lines and crowds, he says. ""It is impossible to measure the risk you may be exposed to in these crowded, uncontrolled environments.  That is why travel causes transmission of COVID and why one of the first steps in controlling the pandemic was limiting travel in those countries which effectively reduced the number of cases and deaths,"" Cutler explains.  And for more on how COVID is spreading, see why You're More Likely to Get COVID From Someone Doing This Than From Coughing.  3 Take precautions while using the airport bathroom.  Cutler also suggests exercising additional caution if you need to use the restroom while in the airport or aboard your flight.  These are high-traffic areas that often have questionable ventilation, and while most airports have stepped up their cleaning regimens amid the pandemic, bathrooms can still pose a heightened threat to travelers. If you do use the bathroom facilities, be sure to wear your mask, limit what you touch by using clean paper towels to operate faucets and doors, and wash and sanitize your hands thoroughly afterward.  And for one thing you don't have to do anymore, check out The One Thing You Can Stop Doing to Avoid COVID, CDC Says.  4 Wear a medical grade mask and face shield.  While on board your flight, Cutler explains that your main concern should be mitigating risk from those seated nearest to you.  ""The ventilation systems on commercial airliners contain HEPA air filters which effectively remove nearly any viral particles,"" Cutler explains.  ""Several small studies have confirmed that the majority of the risk while flying comes from the people immediately around you. ""Luckily, you can slash that risk by coming prepared with the right gear, and by optimizing ventilation.  ""That risk can be minimized by wearing an N95 mask and face shield.  You should also turn your overhead air blower on high to push as much clean air at you as possible,"" Cutler advises.  And for more on mask safety, know that If You're Still Doing This, Your Mask Isn't Protecting You, Study Says.

The 1. 3 update will release on February 3rd, and is split into four events: All That Glitters, Lantern Rite Tales, Theater Mechanicus, and the Xiao Market.  Theater Mechanicus is a tower defense battle where players use a gridded arena to place down towers, then fight alongside them against enemy waves.  The new character Xiao, a 5-star, is at the center of much of the update trailer and will receive a story quest to go with him.  Players will get a raftload of free materials in the update, like rate-up wishes and a mini-event that gives out a free 4-star character from the Liyue crew: Xiangling, Xinyan, Beidou, Ningguang, Xingqu, and Chongyun.  There's also an event coming based on the in-game photo mode, with rewards for well-composed shots.  The other mini-events are a mode based around Geovishap mini-bosses and a Geovishap world boss, and a Ley Line update that gives double loot for the first three Ley Lines each day. Additionally, starting now and lasting until the end of January, an online slime festival game lets you get some bonuses in Genshin proper by making slimes happy.  It's adorable—you can find those details here. We considered Genshin Impact, a free-to-play open world RPG out of China, to be one of 2020's biggest and most pleasant gaming surprises.  The new update will also include some fixes for the resin problem.  You can watch the full English livestream of the update reveal below. #https://www.pcgamer.com/genshin-impact-13-comes-in-february-but-an-adorable-slime-festival-is-out-now/#ToGuSi8MZ

SpaceX's rocket has a relatively high payload capacity compared to the size of many of the small satellites produced today, so a rideshare mission like this offers smaller companies and startups a chance to get their spacecraft in orbit without breaking the bank.  The cargo capsule atop the Falcon 9 flying today holds a total of 133 satellites according to SpaceX, which is a new record for the highest number of satellites being launched on a single rocket – beating out a payload of 104 spacecraft delivered by Indian Space Research Organization's PSLV-C37 launch back in February 2017. #https://finance.yahoo.com/news/watch-spacex-launch-first-dedicated-141102174.html#faMkQXiaj

I'm leaning towards excitement with Resident Evil Village, but familiar concerns are spinning back up.  The series is once again following the trajectory of Resident Evil through Resident Evil 3, where sparse combat scenarios featuring one or two slowly shuffling enemies are replaced with legions of zombies sprinting against machine gun fire.  We're going to need some huge fucking guns to take out Village's big hammer oaf. Are we, once again, set to lose the essence of Resident Evil? Not at all: The essence of Resident Evil is that change.  This is a series defined and elevated by major departures from what came before, including the many, many failures, and that's worth celebrating no matter the outcome.  Resident Evil, warts and all, is a damn wonder. #https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/resident-evil-is-a-creative-miracle/#zoZafsX8j

Between the lines: The freeze went into effect Friday, temporarily halting most immigration enforcement in the U. S.  In the lawsuit, Paxton claims the move ""violates the U. S.  Constitution, federal immigration and administrative law, and a contractual agreement between Texas"" and the Department of Homeland Security.  Be smart: sign up FREE for the most influential newsletter in America.  * Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney, told Axios that the lawsuit is likely to fail at fully reinstating deportations because a judge cannot force Immigration and Customs Enforcement to remove any particular person.  * The executive branch has broad authority over immigration enforcement, as was seen in both President Obama and President Trump's administrations.  What they're saying: In the announcement of the moratorium on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said the pause on deportations would ""allow DHS to ensure that its resources are dedicated to responding to the most pressing challenges that the United States faces. "" * In Paxton's request for a temporary restraining order, he claims, ""Without emergency relief, Texas faces irreparable harm from having to provide costly educational, social, welfare, healthcare, and other services to illegal aliens who remain in Texas because Defendants have ceased removing them.

That's a long time to wait for a sequel to such a well-received game, but that wait is almost over: 505 Games announced today that Puzzle Quest 3 is in development and expected to be out later this year. Puzzle Quest 3 will tell an all-new RPG-infused tale in the land of Etheria, set 500 years after the original game, with its match-3 battle system upgraded with ""new and imaginative gameplay mechanics. "" It will be the first game in the series to be published by 505 Games, which recently acquired developer Infinity Plus Two—previously known as Infinite Interactive, the studio behind the first two games in the series—and will be free to play, also a first for the series. ""After an overwhelming demand from fans over the past decade for the next instalment of Puzzle Quest, we're thrilled to finally reveal the development of Puzzle Quest 3,"" Infinity Plus Two CEO Steve Fawkner said.  ""The vision for this latest project has been years in the making, and like any good Puzzle Quest game, it's a delicate balance of gameplay, story, and strategic puzzle-solving while introducing something unexpected that will appeal to both old and new fans. ""That's a lot to put on the shoulders of a match-3 game, but Puzzle Quest is really good (and still eminently playable, if you're curious) and so I'm glad that a new one is finally on the way.

2021-01-21 20:09:14#business#United Sinks as Airline Says It Can’t Predict Rebound Timing#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-sinks-airline-keeps-mum-160948632.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kJG6vaFQrOpoi1n0nDTubA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8f016d5c84799b6f90ee232bb1eb928f#en#0.4215#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- United Airlines Holdings Inc.  sank after saying it couldn’t predict when a demand rebound would improve results, a cautious outlook that contrasted with Delta Air Lines Inc. ’s forecast last week that it would break even on a cash-flow basis in the second quarter. This year will serve as a “transition” after the collapse in travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic, United said as it reported fourth-quarter earnings.  While pent-up demand will spur more leisure bookings later this year, United declined to bet on a specific timetable. “I know we’ve created a fair bit of angst amongst investors by not being willing to say that we think the inflection point on demand is right around the corner, 60 days away,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said Thursday on a conference call with analysts.  “And we hope it is, but as we said from the beginning, hope is not a strategy. ”Kirby’s caution underscored the risk for airlines in the coming months as the pandemic continues to gut travel demand.  Delta stirred hopes of an imminent rebound by offering specific goal posts last week, reiterating its cash-flow outlook and telling investors that it had a “good shot” at turning a third-quarter profit as vaccines become more widely available. United slid 5. 2% to $42. 83 at 2:33 p. m.  in New York.  That was the biggest drop by far among major U. S.  airlines, which fell less sharply as President Joe Biden’s administration said it planned to require air travelers to wear masks and would enforce quarantines for passengers arriving from other countries. 2023 GoalsInstead of shorter-term markers, United touted its goal of topping pre-pandemic profit margins in 2023.  The company will eventually look back on 2020 as a crisis that enabled executives “to structurally change the airline for the better,” Kirby said. “Whether we reach an inflection point in the spring, the summer or the fall, what we know is that a recovery is coming,” he said. In the fourth quarter, United swung to an adjusted loss of $7 a share, 35 cents worse than the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  For all of 2020, United lost $27. 57 a share, the largest shortfall in its 94-year history. First-quarter operating revenue will fall as much as 70%, the company said, slightly worse than the drop of up to 65% that Delta projected.  Looking ahead, United said it has identified $1. 4 billion in permanent cost cuts, getting it more than halfway to its goal of $2 billion. ‘Inflection Point’The Chicago-based company said customers are eager to travel as Covid-19 vaccine distribution expands.  Consumers appear ready to research trips and travel later this year, said Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella. United expects leisure demand to rebound in the second half, spurred by vaccinations, while business traffic will take 18 to 24 months to recover, he said. The airline is also counting on international profits to outpace domestic performance.  Several carriers have culled large jets such as the Boeing Co.  747 and Airbus SE A380 from their schedules, and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA has scuttled its long-haul network. As a result, Nocella said, capacity is likely to lag demand in many international markets once vaccines become widespread and border restrictions ease. “We do think there is a bunch of structural change there that will lead to stronger relative performance,” he said.  “And that should benefit United more than our competitors. ”(Updates with CEO comment in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

The defect, which in rare instances leads to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.

2021-01-21 00:21:14#health#The White House Just Issued This New Face Mask Policy#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/white-house-just-issued-face-192114460.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yrhb60Rq83FYP8tI3_Mrcw--~B/aD04MzY7dz0xMjU0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/best_life_342/427191b9343093ca7686316b9bcacd89#en#0.0#www.yahoo.com#"For months, major health agencies including the U. S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) have stressed the importance of wearing face masks to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.  And while many state and local officials across the U. S.  have issued mandates for their constituencies, no federal-level orders on the use of face masks have yet been issued.  But on Jan.  20, in the first executive order issued by President Joe Biden, the newest White House resident, a new face mask policy will now require them in certain places. ""The first order I'm going to be signing here relates to COVID,"" Biden told reporters shortly after his inauguration, looking down a stack of 15 executive orders.  ""It's requiring, as I said all along, where I have authority, mandating that masks be worn, social distancing be kept on federal property. "" Read on to see what changes the new face mask policy will bring, and before you mask up, know that If You Have This Mask, Get a New One Now, Experts Say.  The new order requires masks in all federal buildings and lands.  According to CNN, Jeff Zients, a counselor for President Biden who will be the administration's COVID-19 response coordinator, said Biden's mask executive action will ""require compliance with CDC guidance on mask-wearing and physical distancing in federal buildings, on federal lands, and by federal employees and contractors. "" And while the order doesn't apply to all public areas, officials hope that local lawmakers will follow their lead. ""The president will call on governors, public health officials, mayors, business leaders, and others to implement masking, physical distancing, and other public measures to control COVID-19,"" Zients said, adding ""this is not a political statement.  This is about the health of our families, and economic recovery of our country. "" And for the masks that won't help, check out The CDC Warns Against Using These 6 Face Masks.  The order is part of Biden's ""100 Days Masking Challenge. "" The new federal mandate is part of the Biden administration's ""100 Days Masking Challenge,"" which had been previously outlined by the now president before he took office.  The new initiative calls on all Americans to wear a mask for 100 days to help curb the spread of the coronavirus while vaccines are rolled out. ""It is important that we, in fact, the president and the vice president, we set the pattern by wearing masks,"" Biden said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper in December.  ""Just 100 days to mask.  Not forever.  One hundred days.  And I think we'll see a significant reduction … If that occurs, with vaccinations and masking, to drive down the numbers considerably. "" And for more on what could come next in the pandemic, find out why The New CDC Director Just Issued This Very Dark COVID Warning.  Experts agree Biden's mask order could have a positive effect.  Despite face masks being deeply divisive politically, the scientific community widely agrees that the move will likely help in the long term.  This is especially true as winter weather has forced more people to congregate inside, heightening the risk of spreading the virus. ""We have ongoing high levels of community transmission all over this country,"" Chris Beyrer, MD, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, told NBC's Today.  ""With that rate of community transmission, with the infectiousness of this virus and with the weather that we're dealing with (leading to) indoor activity, that really consistent mask-wearing could have a major impact on reducing community transmission. "" And for more COVID news delivered right to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.  But a national mask mandate is not likely.  Biden's new policy will not put a national mask mandate into place, as that might be too lofty, according to Anthony Fauci, MD, who has previously expressed concern that rules that come off as too stringent could make some people less willing to don PPE. During an interview with Kaiser Health News Editor-in-Chief Elisabeth Rosenthal that was published in The New York Times in November, Fauci explained why he wouldn't support a nationwide mask mandate.  ""The only reason that I shy away from making a strong recommendation in that regard is that things that come from the national level down generally engender a bit of pushback from an already reluctant populace that doesn't like to be told what to do,"" he explained.  ""So you might wind up having the countereffect of people pushing back even more.

Markets across the world surged on Wednesday, with the Dow gaining more than 258 points, the S&P 500 up 1. 4% and the Nasdaq up nearly 2%. Former President Donald Trump was anti-immigration, pro-fossil fuel and hostile toward China, said CNBC ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer.  In contrast, Biden is pro-immigration, against fossil fuels and much softer on China, he said.  With a new administration in charge, the U. S.  should see a change in the speed of the coronavirus vaccine rollout, the CNBC host said.  The issue with vaccine rollout is that the federal government gave those involved in the distribution process the same amount of power in deciding what vaccines went where, Cramer said.  ""The problem is, when everyone is in charge, nobody is in charge. "" Here's what Jim Cramer says is ahead in 2021 with Biden in the White House:E-Commerce: The pandemic accelerated the growth of e-commerce, and consumers in 2021 will not slow down on ordering from the comfort of their home, Cramer said.  Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) have only just begun, he said.  Travel and Leisure: Once there is an effective vaccine distribution plan, travel will surge, helping companies like Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), cruise lines, airlines and companies like Boeing (NYSE: BA), the CNBC host said.  Digitization and Cybersecurity: With more technological advancements to come in the cloud realm, Cramer said companies like Servicenow (NYSE: NOW), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and cybersecurity companies such as Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), will all be successful plays in 2021. 5G: A massive worldwide shortage exists of semiconductors allowing for massive growth from chip makers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Intel Corp.  (NASDAQ: INTC) as well as growth from cellphone service providers including T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS). COVID-19 Stimulus: With another round of stimulus payments expected to soon be in the hands of Americans, Cramer said retailers like Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ: COST), Amazon and Target (NYSE: TGT) could see upticks in their first-quarter earnings and continued growth through the year. China: In Cramer's view, Biden is soft on China and companies that are already established in the atmosphere there like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) will benefit. Wealth Management: Last year represented a surge for wealth and asset management companies such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Cramer said. Morgan Stanley was able to capitalize on a new generation of investors who believe that picking your own stocks is a ""good way to manage your money,"" he said.  Remote work: Even with the end of the pandemic on the horizon, remote work is here to stay, Cramer said.  For the last 10 months, millions of white collar employees have worked from home, and eh said studies show that their productivity rose. Companies such as Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM), and Amazon will benefit from the creation of more elaborate home offices, he said.  Health Care: Biden doesn't have the votes in Congress to change much in regards to health care, Cramer said, adding that an effort is likely to try to make health insurance cheaper for working class Americans, boosting companies like Centene (NYSE: CNC) and Humana (NYSE: HUM). Electric Vehicles: With the Democratic Party being strong on fighting climate change, Cramer said people will start to purchase more electric vehicles. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the manufacturers merging with special acquisition companies will see unparalleled growth, he said. General Motors (NYSE: GM) could also see a strong growth year due to its investment in EV manufacturer Rivian, Cramer said.  Housing: With Biden planning on extending policies allowing more freedom for undocumented immigrants, Cramer said millions of people could get credit to buy new homes, adding that homebuilders like Pulte Group (NYSE: PHM) will see increases in demand.

In his time at the head of the US Federal Communications Commission, Pai led the agency to dismantle former chairman Tom Wheeler's strong regulation of telecom companies.  In doing so, Pai prioritized the interests and profits of companies like Comcast and AT&T over everyday people. Good riddance. As acting chair Jessica Rosenworcel steps in with the Biden administration and we wait to see what's ahead, here's a recap of Pai's worst moves over the past four years.  Let's call it a 'what not to do' for President Biden's admin.  (The good news is that Rosenworcel has already been a clear supporter of net neutrality in her time as an FCC commissioner. )#https://www.pcgamer.com/6-times-former-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-made-the-internet-worse/#qHHHHdY8l

The Communist Party's 13th Congress, from Jan.  25 to Feb.  2, will cement leadership looking to leverage Vietnam's economic success to bolster legitimacy.  Key to that will be the challenge of balancing relations with China and the United States, for which Vietnam has become an important strategic partner, in a world economy that's been dislodged from previous certainties. #https://news.yahoo.com/wanted-communist-party-leadership-keep-041949185.html#VmpzDfD77

As it turns out, Sen.  Lindsey Graham (R-S. C. ) may have been his biggest fan. Graham, who called Blinken an ""outstanding choice"" and gave him an elbow bump during a break, asked a series of questions, many of which resulted in answers the senator found quite agreeable.  For example, Blinkin doesn't ""trust"" the Taliban to police al Qaeda and the Islamic State in Afghanistan after a U. S.  exit.  He also considers Iran the world's worst sponsor of terrorism and said he concurs with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's assessment that China is committing genocide against the Uighurs and other religious and ethnic minorities.  That last point reportedly left Graham ""positively gushing. ""> Blinken agrees that the Chinese Communist Party engaged in genocide against the Uighur Muslim population, agrees they were not transparent on Coronavirus.  Lindsey Graham is positively gushing. > > — David B.  Larter (@DavidLarter) January 19, 2021If the friendly exchange was any indication, Blinken won't have much trouble getting confirmed, but the bipartisanship on display did have receive from sharp criticism from supporters of non-interventionist policy.

The move could mark the highest-profile lese majeste case since a wave of anti-government protests emerged last year and extended to criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn over accusations of meddling in politics and taking too much power.  The complaint against Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit under Article 112 of the criminal code came two days after he said the government was too reliant on a company owned by the Crown Property Bureau, which is under the king's personal control, to produce vaccines for Thais. #https://news.yahoo.com/thai-govt-file-royal-defamation-080329240.html#7NltxGndH

Since 2011, the report found, annual rates of methamphetamine overdose deaths have risen across every demographic group in America and are especially high among American Indians and Alaska Natives.  The findings highlight that opioids are not the only drug driving a record spike in overdose deaths in recent years. #https://gizmodo.com/meth-related-deaths-in-america-are-skyrocketing-1846092586#zn6Y2p9i8

""By the middle of February, we expect half a million deaths in this country.  That doesn't speak to the tens of thousands of people who are living with a yet uncharacterized syndrome after they've recovered,"" said incoming Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) head Rochelle Walensky on CBS' Face the Nation.  ""I think we still have some dark weeks ahead. "" Read on to see what the CDC says to stop doing immediately—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus.  1 Avoid Gatherings Immediately ""A gathering refers to a planned or spontaneous event, indoors or outdoors, with a small number of people participating or a large number of people in attendance such as a community event or gathering, concert, festival, conference, parade, wedding, or sporting event,"" says the CDC.  ""The more people an individual interacts with at a gathering and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and COVID-19 spreading. "" Their bottom line: ""Avoid gatherings.  The higher the level of community transmission in the area that the gathering is being held, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spreading during a gathering. "" 2 Stop Standing Close to People Even if They Have a Mask On ""Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don't live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain,"" says the CDC.  ""Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others.  The mask is not a substitute for social distancing. "" 3 Stop Thinking People Without Symptoms Are Healthy The CDC has found that over half of COVID infections are believed to be transmitted asymptomatically—that is, by people who seem healthy, with no symptoms, but carry the infection and give it to you.  Because so many with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, you must assume anyone could be infected.  Even those who have been vaccinated can carry their disease.  ""Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus,"" warns the CDC.  4 Don't Wear Your Mask Wrong The CDC advises you do not choose masks that:""Are made of fabric that makes it hard to breathe, for example, vinylHave exhalation valves or vents which allow virus particles to escapeAre intended for healthcare workers, including N95 respirators or surgical masksDo choose masks that:Have two or more layers of washable, breathable fabricCompletely cover your nose and mouthFit snugly against the sides of your face and don't have gaps. "" 5 Don't Forget to Get Retested If you took a COVID-19 test and it came up negative—but you're still experiencing symptoms, be concerned.  ""People who take an antigen test that comes back negative should get retested if they have symptoms,"" says the CDC. RELATED: If You Feel This, You May Have Already Had COVID, Says Dr.  Fauci 6 How to Survive this Pandemic ""Everyone, regardless of COVID-19 test results, should keep wearing masks, avoiding gatherings,&staying at least 6 feet from others,"" says the CDC simply.  So do so—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.
