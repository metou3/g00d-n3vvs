On Thursday, (February 4) Ofcom concluded that China's ruling Communist Party had ultimate editorial responsibility for the channel, the English-language sister channel of state broadcaster CCTV. Minutes later, China's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing the BBC of pushing ""fake news"" in its COVID-19 reporting, demanding an apology and saying that the broadcaster had politicized the pandemic and ""rehashed theories about covering up by China. ""The BBC's coverage of Xinjiang came under heavy criticism after it reported on Wednesday that women in internment camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the region were subject to rape and torture. China's foreign ministry said the report had no factual basis. The BBC said its reporting is fair and unbiased. On Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin slammed the Ofcom ruling as ""politicizing the issue on a technical point"" and warned that China reserves the right to make a ""necessary response"". ""China urges the UK to immediately cease these political gimmicks, and correct their mistakes.  China maintains the right to make a necessary response in order to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese media. ""China's state media has ramped up attacks on the British public broadcaster in recent weeks. The foreign ministry's criticism of the BBC was among the top trends on China's Weibo social media platform on Friday. BBC broadcasts, like those of most major Western news outlets, are blocked in China. Some people called for the BBC to be expelled in response to CGTN's license being revoked.

The rules will take effect immediately, according to a statement from the State Administration for Market Regulation, the nation’s antitrust watchdog. The regulations will curb anti-competitive behavior such as sharing sensitive consumer data, forming alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing below cost services to eliminate competitors, the regulator said. Read More: China Clampdown on Big Tech Puts More Billionaires on NoticeChina’s Politburo, the top decision-making body of the Communist Party, vowed in a meeting at the end of last year to strengthen anti-monopoly efforts in 2021.  Less than two weeks after the meeting, China kicked off an investigation into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  for allegedly monopolistic practices. Lawsuits over competition issues have been filed by companies even as regulators are moving to step up scrutiny.  ByteDance Ltd.  filed a lawsuit last week against Tencent Holdings Ltd.  over alleged monopolies in its WeChat and QQ platforms, escalating a feud between two giants of Chinese social media.  A court in Beijing has agreed to hear the case, a ByteDance representative confirmed on Sunday.

2021-02-05 21:14:21#tech#Activision Investors Applaud Q4 Report: What The Street Is Saying#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-investors-applaud-q4-report-211421465.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8b1fkFVPGNUO7i9scPIZ9A--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/980613c20cea5c669a56dc6c453fd429#en#0.4588#finance.yahoo.com#"Video game maker Activision Blizzard, Inc.  (NASDAQ: ATVI) reported fourth-quarter results Thursday that lifted shares to a new 52-week high, while four Street analysts see further upside ahead.  The Activision Blizzard Analysts: Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok maintains an Outperform rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with a price target lifted from $109 to $120.  Needham analyst Laura Martin maintains a Buy rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with an unchanged $102 price target.  Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintains an Overweight rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with a price target from $108 to $115.  KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Tyler Parker maintains an Overweight rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with a price target lifted from $102 to $120.  RayJay Sees Strength In 2021, Beyond: Activision Blizzard's revenue rose 13% year-over-year to $3. 05 billion versus the Street’s estimate of $2. 83 billion, Marok said in a note.  Revenue from the Activision segment rose 16% to $1. 66 billion; King revenue was up 15% at $577 million; and Blizzard’s segment revenue was down 3% at $579 million, the analyst said.  The company’s core franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, all showed “robust” bookings growth in the quarter, he said.  Momentum should be sustained in 2021 and beyond ahead of multiple launches, including a potential remaster release this year and World of Warcraft mobile titles that are in advanced development, according to RayJay.  Needham's 5 Key Takeaways: Activision’s earnings report is highlighted by five key takeaways, Martin said in a note.  They are: 1.  The company noted its games reach 400 million players in 190 countries.  2.  Throughout 2020, the company had three game franchises that generated $1 billion in net bookings.  Management guided toward two additional games hitting the $1-billion revenue milestone.  3.  Activision expects to grow in 2021 despite difficult year-over-year comparisons.  View more earnings on ATVI 4.  Management will focus development efforts on its largest franchises with the objective of duplicating the CoD model of monetizing free-to-play games.  5.  Warzone more than doubled its player base and generated a lot of interest in free premium trials.  Related Link: For Some Video Game ETFs, It Was Fun While It Lasted With GameStop Morgan Stanley's Reopening Concerns: Video games were one of several categories that saw a notable uptick in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers were looking for more forms of entertainment at home.  Now that the reopening phase is very slowly starting to take place in some regions, it was ""encouraging"" to hear Activision's management say they are seeing momentum in reopening regions, Nowak said.  Ongoing demand in areas that are more advanced in the reopening process can be attributed to Activision's content and quality of its products, the analyst said.  Encouragingly, Activision's 2021 EPS outlook of $3. 60 could be conservative, he said.  ""Given ATVI's historically pragmatic approach to forward guidance (having beaten their initial full year EPS guidance by 16% on average from '16-'19) we struggle to believe the company would have guided as aggressively as they did without a margin of safety on re-opening. "" KeyBanc Says 2022 Looks Big': Activision's fourth-quarter report came in better than expected, and the company's outlook through 2022 ""looks big,"" Parker said in a note.  Activision's 2021 bookings guidance was stronger than expected despite the absence of a new AAA game this year, the analyst said.  This suggests ongoing strength in the broader gaming market, but also momentum across Activision's portfolio, he said.  Activision hinted at a ""step-function change"" in 2022 that will be driven by a WoW expansion, a ramp in Diablo Immortal and a potential Overwatch 2 release, Parker said.  ""ATVI's franchise strategy to expand offerings to more platforms and models is working, and we believe there are multiple opportunities in place to grow the business for years to come.

House Democrats voted to boot her from her committee assignments in an act that they will surely come to regret, perhaps as soon as January 2023.  If the majority can keep members of the opposition party off of committees based on incendiary comments, it’s not clear why the GOP ever let, say, Maxine Waters serve on any committees when it had control of the chamber, or why it ever will again.  Kicking off Greene will come to be remembered as another inflection point in the steady unraveling of institutional norms on Capitol Hill.  That said, we believe that Republicans should have taken matters into their own hands and denied Greene her committee assignments to draw a line against malicious lunacy in their own ranks.  That Democrats had a gun to his head with their threat to have a floor vote on Greene’s committee assignments probably made it more politically difficult for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to act on his own.  He did seek a deal with the Democrats to take her off the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Budget Committee and instead relegate her to the Small Business Committee.  When Democrats didn’t bite, McCarthy again condemned her past comments and wrung an expression of regret from her in an internal GOP meeting earlier in the week that she repeated on the House floor on Thursday.  Her statement didn’t ring with sincerity, but it was better than nothing, even if she was immediately holding a combative press conference where she said, “I’m fine with being kicked off committees because it’d be a waste of my time. ” We have, no doubt, not heard the last of her. #https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-regret-move-against-marjorie-113058115.html#RwBEmsorR

It's not clear if Biden will officially cut off Trump's access, but such a move would be unprecedented — traditionally, former presidents can request and receive briefings.  David Priess, who briefed former President George H. W.  Bush for many years after he left office, told The Washington Post that ex-presidents continue to receive intelligence briefings because even though they're no longer in an official position of power, they are considered representatives of the United States, especially by foreign leaders, for the rest of their lives.  He added that presidents also may turn to their predecessors for advice on international affairs.  That said, Priess agrees with Biden that an exception could be made for Trump since ""there's no chance of Biden reaching out to Trump . . .  So why would Biden run the risk of Trump's disclosure of sensitive information by agreeing to such briefings?"" Journalist Yashar Ali did note that former presidents can also interact with other governments privately, as former President Bill Clinton did when he traveled to North Korea in 2009 to secure the release of two journalists being held there.  Clinton, Ali, notes was briefed even though it wasn't an official U. S.  government trip.  2.  For example, when President Clinton when to North Korea to secure the release of two journalists who were being held by Kim Jong-Il, he was given an intelligence briefing even though the trip was a private one and not an official US government trip.  — Yashar Ali (@yashar) February 6, 2021 Of course, Trump wasn't exactly known for devouring his daily briefings while in office, so it's not clear sending them now would offer the Biden administration much comfort, either way.

ChrisChrisW/iStock via Getty Images PlusThe effect of a drug, or impact of a treatment like chemotherapy, doesn’t just depend on your body.  The success of a particular medicine also depends on the trillions of bacteria in your gut.  The 100 trillion bacteria that live within the human digestive tract – known as the human gut microbiome – help us extract nutrients from food, boost the immune response and modulate the effects of drugs.  Recent research, including my own, has implicated the gut microbiome in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism.  What underlies these apparently discrete observations is the unifying idea that the gut microbiota send signals beyond the gut and that these signals have broad effects on a large swathe of target tissues.  I am a medical oncologist whose research involves developing novel therapies for melanoma.  To evaluate whether altering the microbiome could benefit cancer patients, my colleagues and I evaluated the transfer of fecal matter from melanoma patients who responded well to immunotherapy to those patients for whom immunotherapy failed.  Just published in the journal Science, our results reveal that this treatment helped shrink the tumors of advanced melanoma patients when other therapies hadn’t worked.  What connects cancer and gut bacteria? Gut microbiota have been linked to to the success and failure of multiple cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab.  In the more recent studies, the species and relative populations of gut bacteria determined the probability that a cancer patient would respond to drugs known as “immune checkpoint inhibitors. ” This research showed that differences in the gut microbiome between individual patients were associated with various outcomes to these drugs.  But the precise mechanisms underlying microbiome-immune interactions remain unclear.  Can fecal microbes help drugs reach hard to treat melanoma? Oncologists often treat patients with advanced melanoma using immunotherapies targeting specific proteins on the surface of immune cells known as PD-1 and CTLA-4.  These work in a subset of patients, however – 50%-70% of patients have cancers that get worse despite treatment.  No medical treatments have been approved to treat melanoma patients who have failed PD-1 immunotherapies.  To investigate whether certain types of microbes could boost the efficacy of PD-1 immunotherapies, my colleagues and I developed a study in which we collected fecal microbes from patients who had responded well to this therapy and administered these to cancer patients who didn’t benefit from the checkpoint drugs.  Cancer patients who responded well to immunotherapy donated stool samples.  Their stool was processed to yield material for a fecal microbe transplant.  Diwakar Davar, CC BY-ND We chose stool from patients who responded well to immunotherapy based on the hunch that they would have greater quantities of bacteria implicated in helping shrink the cancer.  As it is difficult to identify one or two species of bacteria that are responsible for the beneficial response to these therapies, we used the entire bacterial community – hence fecal microbe transplant.  Transplant recipients were patients whose melanoma had never responded to immunotherapy.  Both recipients and donors underwent screening for diseases to ensure that no infectious agents would be transmitted during the transplant.  Following a biopsy of their tumor, patients received a fecal microbe transplant from patients who benefited from immunotherapy along with a drug called called pembrolizumab, which was continued every three weeks.  My colleagues and I assessed the fecal microbe transplant 12 weeks after the treatment.  Patients whose cancers had shrunk or remained the same size after the fecal microbe transplant continued to receive pembrolizumab for up to two years.  Results of novel clinical trial Cancer patients who responded poorly to immunotherapy were given a fecal microbe transplant from a cancer patient who did well and a drug called pembrolizumab.  For some of the patients, the microbe transplant made the immunotherapy work.  Diwakar Davar, CC BY-ND Following this fecal microbe transplant treatment, tumors of six out of 15 patients in the study had tumors that shrank or remained the same.  The treatment was well tolerated, though some of the patients experienced minor side effects including fatigue.  When we analyzed the gut microbiota of treated patients, we observed that the six patients whose cancers had stabilized or improved showed increased numbers of bacteria that had previously been associated with responses to immunotherapy.  My colleagues and I also analyzed the blood and tumors from responders.  In doing so, we observed that the responders had lower levels of adverse immune cells termed myeloid cells, and higher levels of memory immune cells.  Additionally, by analyzing proteins in the blood serum of treated patients, we observed reductions in levels of key immune system molecules associated with resistance in responders.  These results suggest that introducing certain intestinal microorganisms into a patient’s colon may help the patient respond to drugs that enhance the immune system’s ability to recognize and kill tumor cells.  Ultimately we hope to move beyond fecal microbe transplants to specific collections of microbes in cancers besides melanoma, paving the way for standardized microbe-based drug therapy to treat immunotherapy-resistant tumors.
