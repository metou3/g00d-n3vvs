S.  stock futures dropped as rising Treasury yields brought renewed pressure to equities with lofty valuations.  Contracts on the Nasdaq 100 fell 2% in early trading and S&P 500 futures were lower, tracking losses in Asia.  Ten-year Treasury yields topped 1. 6%, sparking a rally in European financial shares.  The dollar strengthened against all its major peers.  Brent crude traded near $70 a barrel after Saudi Arabia said the world’s largest crude terminal was attacked on Sunday by a drone from the sea.  The missiles were intercepted and oil output appeared to be unaffected. “You will see a lot of volatility in markets,” Kim Stafford, Asia Pacific head at Pacific Investment Management Co. , said on Bloomberg Television.  “We believe that confidence is improving, especially with vaccines coming online, so we will see an uptick in growth globally.  There are a lot of reasons to be confident in the market, but a lot of this is also priced in. ”Global markets have become preoccupied by the risks associated with rising Treasury yields and fears that government stimulus programs could overheat economic growth.  Higher yields also raise questions about whether equity valuations have become excessive, especially in speculative tech shares.  The Nasdaq 100 Index has fallen almost 10% since early February. Meanwhile, China’s main stock benchmark entered a correction on Monday on concerns about liquidity conditions and lofty valuations in some of the recently favored stocks.  The CSI 300 Index fell 3. 5%, piercing through its 100-day moving average and putting losses from its recent February 10 peak to 13%.  Here are some key events to watch:The annual session of China’s National People’s Congress continues in Beijing. Japan GDP is due Tuesday. EIA crude oil inventory report is due WednesdayThe U. S.  February consumer price index will offer the latest look at price pressures Wednesday. The European Central Bank holds its monetary policy meeting and President Christine Lagarde is set to do a briefing Thursday.

2021-03-06 15:08:58#local#FBI Finds Contact Between Proud Boys Member and Trump Associate Before Riot#https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-finds-contact-between-proud-150858120.html#https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FT5bOFjJOqFmHSZ9XsP0ng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMzMz/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aHGeFD7chb6fToGf5Q_b6A--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/06db9a056fa776cf3cf75b35bd0c5d5a#en#-0.128#news.yahoo.com#WASHINGTON — A member of the far-right nationalist Proud Boys was in communication with a person associated with the White House in the days just before the Jan.  6 assault on the Capitol, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.  Location, cellular and call record data revealed a call tying a Proud Boys member to the Trump White House, the official said.  The FBI has not determined what they discussed, and the official would not reveal the names of either party.  The connection revealed by the communications data comes as the FBI intensifies its investigation of contacts among far-right extremists, Trump White House associates and conservative members of Congress in the days before the attack.  Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The same data has revealed no evidence of communications between the rioters and members of Congress during the deadly attack, the official said.  That undercuts Democratic allegations that some Republican lawmakers were active participants that day.  Separately, Enrique Tarrio, a leader of the far-right nationalist Proud Boys, told The New York Times on Friday that he called Roger Stone, a close associate of former President Donald Trump’s, while at a protest in front of the home of Sen.  Marco Rubio, R-Fla.  During the protest, which occurred in the days before the Capitol assault, he put Stone on speaker phone to address the gathering.  A law enforcement official said that it was not Tarrio’s communication with Stone that was being scrutinized, and that the call made in front of Rubio’s home was a different matter.  That two members of the group were in communication with people associated with the White House underscores the access that violent extremist groups like the Proud Boys had to the White House and to people close to the former president.  Stone denied “any involvement or knowledge of the attack on the Capitol” in a statement last month to the Times.  Tarrio was arrested in Washington on Jan.  4 on charges of destruction of property for his role in the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner that had been torn from a historic Black church during a protest in Washington in December.  He was asked to leave the city, and was not present when the Capitol was attacked.  His case is pending.  The Justice Department has charged more than a dozen members of the Proud Boys with crimes related to the attack, including conspiracy to obstruct the final certification of President Joe Biden’s electoral victory and to attack law enforcement officers.  In court papers, federal prosecutors have said groups of Proud Boys also coordinated travel to Washington and shared lodging near the city, with the intent of disrupting Congress and advancing Trump’s efforts to unlawfully maintain his grip on the presidency.  The communication between the person associated with the White House and the member of the Proud Boys was discovered in part through data that the FBI obtained from technology and telecommunications companies immediately after the assault.  Court documents show FBI warrants for a list of all the phones associated with the cell towers serving the Capitol, and that it received information from the major cellphone carriers on the numbers called by everyone on the Capitol’s cell towers during the riot, three officials familiar with the investigation said.  The FBI also obtained a “geofence” warrant for all the Android devices that Google recorded within the building during the assault, the officials said.  A geofence warrant legally gives law enforcement a list of mobile devices that are able to be identified in a particular geographic area.  Jill Sanborn, the head of counterterrorism at the FBI, testified before a Senate panel Wednesday that all the data the FBI had gathered in its investigation into the riot was obtained legally through subpoenas and search warrants.  Although investigators have found no contact between the rioters and members of Congress during the attack, those records have shown evidence in the days leading up to Jan.  6 of communications between far-right extremists and lawmakers who were planning to appear at the rally featuring Trump that occurred just before the assault, according to one of the officials.  The Justice Department is examining those communications, but it has not opened investigations into any members, the official said.  A department spokesperson declined to comment.  The FBI did, however, say Thursday that it had arrested a former State Department aide on charges related to the attack, including unlawful entry, violent and disorderly conduct, obstructing Congress and law enforcement, and assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon.  The former midlevel aide, Federico Klein, who was seen in videos assaulting officers with a stolen riot shield, was the first member of the Trump administration to face criminal charges in connection with the storming of the Capitol.  His lawyer declined to comment Friday.  Right-wing extremists, including members of the Oath Keepers, a militia group that mainly comprises former law enforcement and military personnel, have been working as security guards for Republicans and for Trump’s allies, such as Stone.  Stone, who was pardoned by Trump after refusing to cooperate with the investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russian intelligence, has known Tarrio for some time and used Oath Keepers as bodyguards before and on the day of the assault on the Capitol.  The Justice Department is looking into communications between Stone and far-right extremists to determine whether he played any role in plans by extremists to disrupt the certification on Jan.  6, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak about the investigation.  Should investigators find messages showing that Stone had any connection to such plans, they would have a factual basis to open a full criminal investigation into him, the people said.  Stone said last month that he was “provided voluntary security by the Oath Keepers,” but noted that their security work did not constitute evidence that he was involved in, or informed about, plans to attack Congress.  He reiterated an earlier statement that anyone involved in the attack should be prosecuted.  The Justice Department has charged more than 300 people with crimes stemming from the Jan.  6 assault.  It has used evidence gathered in its broad search for assailants — including information from cellular providers and technology companies — to help piece together evidence of more sophisticated crimes, like conspiracy.  It is also looking at possible charges of seditious conspiracy, according to two people familiar with the investigation.

Chinese parliamentarians in Beijing unveiled details of a plan to revamp the political structure of China's freest city that critics say has all but killed off the pledge of one person, one vote.  China's move comes months after a sweeping national security law was imposed on the Asian financial hub, cracking down on dissent, and more than a year after months of sometimes violent anti-China, pro-democracy protests which swept the city. #https://news.yahoo.com/analysis-end-road-hong-kongs-133735896.html#hmD9yrt8t

Driving the news: The top-line targets for 2025, per state media, aim to lower energy intensity by 13. 5% and carbon emissions intensity by 18% — that is, measures of energy use and emissions relative to economic output.

Yes, but: Greenpeace's Li Shuo, who tracks Chinese policy carefully, called the plan an ""indecisive signal"" that simply incorporates China's existing intentions. ""These targets represent the intention of the Chinese government to implement the climate announcement made by President Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit last December.  But they do not go further than that,"" he said in a brief analysis. ""The plan also defers key questions of how China intends to accelerate its decarbonization into the future,"" Li wrote. ""We were hoping for more answers on climate issues, but what we got are more questions,"" he told the Financial Times. Why it matters: China is by far the world's largest carbon emitter. The country pledged in September to have its emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, but concrete steps toward those goals remain hazy at best. And, as AP notes, the plan ""did not mention any ban on new coal projects, which experts say would be a significant step. ""What we're watching: The relative absence of new info raises the stakes of Biden administration moves to secure stronger efforts in forthcoming diplomacy — including the climate summit the White House is convening next month. Li, meanwhile, said he's watching for more detailed documents to follow, such as ""sectoral"" 5-year plans and a climate-specific plan.

You've just dropped into a match of Apex Legends, only to find one of your squadmates has sprinted off on their lonesome, ready to solo every other team on the battlefield—leaving the other two at a disadvantage.  Fortunately, Apex will soon let these lone wolves queue up without hindering a team, but be warned—this isn't exactly a proper solos mode. Chaos Theory, the game's next Collection Event, is adding a ""No Fill"" toggle, letting Apex know that you don't want your squad filled out with strangers.  So yeah, play solo if you want.  Just know that you'll still be pitting yourself against two- or three-person teams.  Hey, maybe you're just that good. Respawn has toyed with temporary solo modes in the past, but isn't too keen on making in a permanent option.  No-fill, then, is an attempt to compromise with the hotshots out there who want to test their luck while still retaining the game's team spirit. ""We still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay.  But we’re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way.

Sprawling, imaginative, and featuring one of King’s more dynamic tween heroes, The Talisman has been a fixation for potential adaptors for years—most notably in the hands of Steven Spielberg, who bought the rights to the book before it was even published back in the 1980s, and who’s spent decades trying to put the pieces in place for his Amblin Entertainment to get it on the screen. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/steven-spielberg-taps-stranger-things-013600461.html#XYw33JzcQ

A coronavirus variant circulating in Brazil is likely able to reinfect people who survived infections with earlier versions of the coronavirus, new data suggest.  The variant that emerged in Brazil, called P. 1, carries a mutation that is already known to make a variant prevalent in South Africa harder to treat with antibodies and harder to prevent with available vaccines. #https://news.yahoo.com/brazil-variant-reinfect-virus-survivors-210105030.html#Yyw8dGZ2T
