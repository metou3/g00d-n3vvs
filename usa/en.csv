2021-03-01 12:46:51#business#China Region Declares War on Crypto Mining, Stirring Wider Fear#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-rises-china-region-declares-095643753.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ohFpuAo0HGd_vN_R05X5IA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/99e3cb5b48de8638383b81f492cdd316#en#-0.7964#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- China’s Inner Mongolia has banned cryptocurrency mining and declared it will shut all such projects by April, spurring fears the world’s No.  2 economy will take more steps to eradicate the power-hungry practice. The autonomous region, a favorite among the industry because of its cheap power, also banned new digital coin projects, according to a draft plan posted on the Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission’s website Feb.  25.  The aim is to constrain growth in energy consumption to about 1. 9% in 2021. Bitcoin extended gains on Monday amid reports of the move, increasing as much as 6% in the session to $47,970. The announcement unnerved an industry that’s already been through a years-long Chinese campaign to clamp down amid concerns over speculative bubbles, fraud and energy waste.  The draft policy was released weeks after China’s top economic planner blasted Inner Mongolia for being the only province to fail to control energy consumption in 2019. The region now aims to cut emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 3% this year and limit incremental growth of energy consumption to about 5 million tons of standard coal, according to the draft plan. Chinese officials first outlined proposals in 2018 to discourage crypto-mining -- the computing process that makes transactions with virtual currencies possible but consumes vast amounts of power. Inner Mongolia, which is clustered with large coal mines, is famous for inexpensive energy and has attracted investment from a plethora of power-intensive sectors such as aluminum and ferro-alloy smelting over past decades.  The region accounted for 8% of global Bitcoin mining computing power, according to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index compiled by Cambridge University.  China overall had over 65% of the network’s total, with its appealing combination of inexpensive electricity, local chipmaking factories and cheap labor. The local crackdown is reviving old fears.  Beijing since 2017 has abolished initial coin offerings and clamped down on virtual currency trading within its borders, forcing many exchanges overseas.  The country was once home to about 90% of trades but the lion’s share of mining and major players like Bitmain Technologies Ltd.  have since fled abroad. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  and Nvidia Corp.  are among listed chipmakers that supply crypto miners in China and around the world.

In February it enjoyed roughly 70,000 more concurrent players on Steam than the month before.  As February draws to a close, SteamDB recorded it having a record-breaking peak player count of 198,235.  That's five days after the two-year anniversary collection event ended too.  Season 8 certainly seems to have struck a chord, whether due to Caustic seeing a resurgence and other changes in the Ranked meta, or the arrival of new legend Fuse, or the return of the popular King's Canyon map (with some tweaks), or some alchemical combination of other changes. After arriving on Steam in November of 2020, Apex Legends has cemented its position in the platform's top 10 games.  If you're thinking of getting into it, or need a few tips, here's our Apex Legends character guide. #https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-hits-record-steam-player-count-with-198235-concurrents/#R24xS8knB

Farrow.  Farrow’s mother, actress Mia Farrow, recorded conversations with her daughter about the alleged abuse after a babysitter claimed to have seen Allen’s face “buried” in Dylan’s lap.  In the videos, Farrow explicitly says Allen touched her inappropriately.  Allen has repeatedly denied all allegations.  Before the episode aired, Farrow posted a lengthy tweet expressing the terror she felt in allowing herself to be so vulnerable, but hoped it may help adults better understand how an abused child might speak about such experiences.  “I decided to let them share it in hopes that Little Dylan’s voice might now help others suffering in silence feel heard, understood and less alone,” Farrow wrote.  “And that my testimony might also help parents, relatives, friends, loved ones and the world in general understand first-hand how an abused child might speak and interpret these horrific events. ”#https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/video-7-old-dylan-farrow-084158086.html#mDQiKYsA4

E3 2020 was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and while the ESA looked for ways to replace it with an ""online experience"", in the end nothing came of it.  Earlier this year the ESA suggested said that, ""we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021 and will soon share exact details on how we're bringing the global video game community together"" and the above document contains the note, ""Working with production team on broadcast options at LA Live/LACC"".  While it's certainly possible an online version of E3 might come together, even before the pandemic Sony had left E3 to host its own event, and thanks to 2020 the likes of Ubisoft and Bethesda now have experience holding showcase events independently.  The Convention and Tourism Development Board document notes that they are, ""Working on 2022 and 2023 license"", but there's a chance that if things don't come together this year we simply won't see E3 return. Last year we held our regular PC Gaming Show as an online event with more than 50 games on show. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/unsurprisingly-e3-2021s-live-event-seems-to-have-been-cancelled/#7SWLnRRU6

EST in the Gulf of Mexico, Theta, right, and a tropical wave to the south that became Tropical Storm Iota.  An overheating world obliterated weather records in 2020 - an extreme year for hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, droughts and ice melt - the United Nations' weather agency reported Wednesday, Dec.  2, 2020.  (NOAA via AP) A group of scientists from Europe presented new research this week claiming that the Gulf Stream is weaker now than it's been at any point over the last 1,000 years.  The Gulf Stream is an Atlantic Ocean current that plays a largely hidden role in shaping weather patterns in the United States.  Much has been researched and learned about the influential current over the past 500 years, particularly due to the expertise of one of America's Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin.  But in recent decades, a shift in the Gulf Stream's circulation has become weaker than any other time over the last millennium, according to a recently published study by scientists from Ireland, Britain and Germany.  The weakening of the Gulf Stream, formally known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), can be mostly pinned to one catalyst, the researchers said: human-caused climate change.  The Gulf Stream current moves a massive amount of water across the Atlantic Ocean.  According to Stefan Rahmstorf, one of the study's authors, it moves nearly 20 million cubic meters of water per second, acting like a giant conveyor belt.  How strong of a current is that? ""Almost a hundred times the Amazon flow,"" he told the Potsdam Institute.  The Gulf Stream location in the Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System model (RTOFS) from 2016.  (Image via NOAA) The main function of the Gulf Stream is to redistribute heat on Earth by way of the ocean current.  The ocean circulatory system plays a crucial role in many weather patterns around the world, particularly along the U. S.  East Coast.  Rahmstorf said that his team's research was groundbreaking for being able to combine previous bits of research to piece together a 1,600-year-old picture of the AMOC evolution.  ""The study results suggest that it has been relatively stable until the late 19th century,"" he said.  ""With the end of the little ice age in about 1850, the ocean currents began to decline, with a second, more drastic decline following since the mid-20th century. "" An original mapping of the Gulf Stream from Timothy Folger and Benjamin Franklin from 1768.  (Image via Library of Congress) So what are the implications of this decline in the ocean currents? AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Bob Smerbeck said it could plausibly lead to rising sea levels if water levels are warmed this year.  However, Smerbeck added that it is tricky to know just how warm the waters could get.  Previously, studies have shown that rising water temperatures and higher sea levels can lead to more extreme weather events such as stronger tropical storms, a higher likelihood for extreme heat waves or a decrease in summer rainfall.  However, other researchers have also come out with contrasting data, suggesting that the Gulf Stream hasn't actually declined over the past 30 years.  Using a different data modeling system, researchers from the United Kingdom and Ireland pieced together data from climate models that they said in a study published earlier this month showed ""no overall AMOC decline. "" ""Our results reinforce that adequately capturing changes to the deep circulation is key to detecting any anthropogenic climate-change-related AMOC decline,"" the authors write in their study, which was written just days before Rahmstorf's team published its research on the topic.  Smerbeck, who has been a meteorologist at AccuWeather for nearly 25 years, urged caution in how to interpret the new research claims.  ""One possible repercussion discussed in article 1 [the first study mentioned above] about warming waters along the east coast from an AMOC slowdown could lead to rising sea levels due to thermal expansion of the seawater.  This seems plausible,"" Smerbeck said.  But, he added that the amount of seawater rise would depend on how warm that waters could get and he wasn't ready to speculate on that.  This undated engraving shows the scene on July 4, 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was approved by the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, Pa.  The document, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Philip Livingston and Roger Sherman, announces the separation of 13 North American British colonies from Great Britain.  The formal signing by 56 members of Congress began on Aug.  2.  (AP Photo) How was the Gulf Stream as we know it today discovered? Well, the discovery was fueled by a need for increased efficiency with the mail service and was inspired by the empiricism of whalers.  In 1768, Benjamin Franklin was working in London as deputy postmaster, according to The Smithsonian Magazine, responsible for overseeing the arrival of mail to and from the American colonies.  His cousin, Timothy Folger, worked as a captain of a merchant ship at that same time.  One day, Franklin asked Folger why his merchant ships arrived at the colonies much faster than Franklin's mail ships made it back to England.  Folger explained to his cousin that merchant captains followed the advice of whalers, who followed a ""warm, strong current"" to track and kill whales.  While Franklin said mail captains were too prideful to follow the advice of ""simple American fishermen,"" sailing against the current was costing precious time, according to author Laura Bliss.  So Folger sketched out a general location of the current for Franklin, dubbing it the ""Gulph Stream. "" However, Franklin's mail carriers refused to follow the directions.  A chart of the Gulf Stream, published in 1786 in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.  (Image via Library of Congress, Geography and Map Division) But when Franklin switched allegiances to the burgeoning United States during the Revolutionary War, he mapped out a more precise route of the AMOC and gave it to French allies, providing them a key advantage in the battle of European Maritimers, according to The Smithsonian.  The combination of Folger's whaling knowledge and Franklin's mapping would become crucial in later understanding the importance of the current, even if they originally were just trying to figure out how to deliver mail faster.  While knowledge of the AMOC may only go back a few hundred years, Smerbeck said the dating of the currents can be done in a variety of different ways.  Direct measurements with deep-ocean instruments only go back to 2004, he said, but other methods can help piece together the puzzle, such as analysis of coral and historical data from ship logs.  ""Tree rings can tell how wet or dry the nearby land climate was in the past, which can be linked to sea surface temperatures,"" Smerbeck explained.  ""Ice cores can pretty much tell the same thing as well as how warm or cold it was in the past,"" he said.  ""Ocean sediments can show if there were high or low runoff periods from nearby precipitation over land, which could be linked to how warm or cold sea surface temperatures were in the past. "" Researchers have used all of these clues to inform the understanding, which stretches back more than a millennium, they've developed of the Gulf Stream.
