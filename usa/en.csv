What Happened: ""Those who have built the Bitcoin and supported the dream of making this new kind of money a reality have done a fabulous job of sustaining that dream and moving Bitcoin into being an alternative gold-like asset,"" Dalio said in a note to the hedge fund clients on Thursday.  The hedge fund manager made the clarification of his stance on the cryptocurrency to clear the air on the different interpretations in the media.  ""I believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention,"" Dalio wrote.  The hedge fund manager clarified that by ""Bitcoin,"" he means the leading cryptocurrency and ""its analogous competitors. "" The fact that a new of money was invented through a system that is programmed into a computer and is rapidly gaining popularity both as a type of money as well as a ""storehold of wealth"" is an ""amazing accomplishment,"" he added.  Dalio sees it as a gold-like safe-haven investment, satiating the growing need for money or ""storehold of wealth assets"" that are limited in supply and can be privately held.  Why It's Important: Bitcoin, which was trading around the $11,000 level in October, has been going higher ever since and ended 2020 with a 300% gain.  The leading cryptocurrency traded at $34,121. 46 at press time.

The trade puts Silver Lake and its co-investors in the black following a $600 million convertible bond investment that the private equity firm made in AMC in 2018.  Such an outcome looked unlikely when AMC, the world's largest movie theater chain, was battling to stave off bankruptcy last summer, a move it avoided thanks to a debt restructuring deal with Silver Lake and its creditors. #https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-lake-cashes-amc-713-001059970.html#Mo9VOCESA

The California oil titan lost a penny per share during the fourth quarter, compared with the Bloomberg Consensus for a 7-cent profit due to a weak performance from its refineries, where runs were reduced substantially in response to lower demand for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline.  Analysts expressed disappointment that the company failed to raise its first-quarter dividend despite having lower debt than peers. “The absolute metrics do not make for great reading,” Alastair Syme, a London-based analyst at Citigroup Inc. , wrote in a note.  “The simple message is that Chevron (and integrated oil company peers) is not well suited to a sub-$50 oil price world. ”A substantial rally in oil and gas prices since Covid-19 vaccines were first approved in early November isn’t enough to lift the doom and gloom surrounding Big Oil stocks.  While executives will use the extra cash to pay down debt and begin to rebuild their reputations with investors, steep hurdles remain.  Chevron won’t resume its production growth plan for the Permian before the pandemic is in the rearview mirror, sees continued pressure in its refining division and is taking a cautious approach to shareholder payouts, executives said. READ: Chevron Says Permian Growth Restart Depends on Pandemic, OPEC+The stock dropped as much as 4. 6% Friday, underperforming the S&P 500 Energy Index which traded 3. 2% lower at 2:05 p. m.  in New York. While Brent crude traded up 0. 7% to $55. 92 a barrel, near the highest since February, there’s “downside risk” to prices, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on a conference call with analysts. “We are still in the middle of a pandemic, demand is still off and in total the global economy is functioning below its capacity,” he said.  “Oil prices today are supported in part by a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take a million barrels a day off the market. ”Chevron maintained its dividend at $1. 29 a share this week, in contrast to a hike in the first quarter of last year.  “Some people were maybe a little surprised you didn’t increase your dividend the other day,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.  analyst Phil Gresh said on the call. Wirth said cuts to capital spending and costs last year means that Chevron now generates free cash flow in excess of its dividend at oil prices below $50 a barrel and that growing the payout in the future is the company’s top priority. Evidence of why a cautious approach is needed came in Chevron’s fourth-quarter results.  Even after aggressively cutting capital spending by a third, it was still almost $3 billion more than incoming cash flow.  That meant borrowing more to protect dividends, contributing to a 64% increase in debt to $44. 3 billion in 2020.  To be sure, half of the rise in borrowing came from the recent acquisition of Noble Energy. Low crude prices and $338 million in losses from Chevron’s global network of refineries wiped out most of the gains from harvesting oil and gas during the quarter.  Crude input at its U. S.  refineries dropped by 17% in response to fewer orders for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline. “We’ll see a recovery in the upstream that’s going to happen a little bit before the downstream,” Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said during a Bloomberg TV interview.  Though uncertainty remains, the second half of this year “looks more like normal. ”Added costs amounted to the recent acquisition of Noble Energy totaling $120 million, higher pension charges and downtime at Australian liquefied natural gas operations also weighed on earnings. When asked about Chevron’s approach to the energy transition, Wirth stuck to the script, insisting that the company would not invest heavily in anything where it doesn’t hold a competitive advantage, like wind and solar, drawing a contrast with European rivals.  Chevron’s strategy is to lower emissions from its own operations including power sources and invest in carbon capture and small-scale technology ventures that have a competitive edge.  He sounded caution on soaring valuations of clean-energy start-ups. “Things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term,” Wirth said.  “When the day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment?”(Updates with CEO comment in sixth paragraph. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

S. , and the company will ask federal regulators for approval in February.  Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna candidates, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is administered in one shot.  The vaccine uses a relatively new technology to deliver a coronavirus gene into the body by using a modified form of the common cold.  The gene instructs bodily cells to make a protein similar to coronavirus, which wards off infection.  While the vaccine is not as effective as those of Pfizer and Moderna, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is still strong enough to give widespread protection from coronavirus.  The company has the ability to ship millions of doses, and a February approval would add the vaccine to the tools currently being used to fight the pandemic.  While the vaccine’s efficacy rate was 72 percent in the U. S. , that rate dropped to 57 percent in trials in South Africa, where a new variant of coronavirus is spreading.  The variant, labeled B. 1. 351, has also been found to slightly reduce the efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.  Concern over the variant prompted the Biden administration to impose a travel ban from South Africa earlier this week. #https://news.yahoo.com/johnson-johnson-releases-single-dose-135027318.html#N9rN6mT3e

What Happened: Dogecoin, a digital currency that was launched as a joke, has surpassed all-time high today, growing by 420. 29% in a matter of one day, according to a data analytics platform CoinMarketCap.  The cryptocurrency is currently traded at $0. 03831 at the time of publishing.  pic. twitter. com/a6kmk0PEgM — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 28, 2021 Musk’s followers recognized the tweet as an endorsement to the current Dogecoin rally, expressing overwhelming support in the Dogecoin future.  Why It Matters: This is not the first time Elon Musk has expressed his interest in the digital currency.  See also: Today’s Dogecoin Price In December, Tesla CEO tweeted “One word: Doge” sending the cryptocurrency to a 20% surge.  Before that, his July tweet caused a 14% spike in Dogecoin price.  CoinMarketCap Head of Listings, however, in a conversation with Benzinga has warned traders about possible ramifications following a call to buy Dogecoin in a Reddit group that caused the recent price spike.  ""It bears mentioning that all of this [the spike and the Reddit thread]takes place against a discernible shift in the cultural milieu, one where WSB has become emblematic of a grassroots Reddit movement that seeks to repudiate the entrenched interests and ossified power structures of WallStreet.  With his 'Gamestonk' tweet, Elon Musk -- himself the subject of legal entanglements with the establishment (SEC) and erstwhile self-proclaimed Dogecoin CEO -- has not only added rocket fuel to ignite Doge's price action on a SpaceX mission to the moon, but also a offered a familiar face for 'Robinhood traders' to coalesce around. ” Read Next: As Elon Musk Touts Dogecoin Again, Here's What You Should Know About The Cryptocurrency Image: missionisgreat via Twitter Learn more about cryptocurrencies See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaBiggest US Crypto Exchange Coinbase Announces Decision To Become PublicDogecoin Price Surges 150% After Redditors Encouragement To Buy© 2021 Benzinga. com.

The company, based in the Hainan provincial capital of Haikou, was served with a petition on January 29 in the provincial High Court seeking its bankruptcy and for it to undergo restructuring, HNA Group said in a statement on its WeChat account.  The company will cooperate with the court's review, push forward with the debt restructuring work and support the court to protect the legitimate rights and interests of creditors, HNA Group said.  Company executives could not be reached to elaborate.  Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.  HNA Group was established on the foundations of Hainan Airlines in 1993 by Chen Feng, who worked for the civil aviation authority before going into business.  With a handful of aircraft, Hainan Airlines quickly built a business flying holiday makers and Russian tourists from China's frigid north to the country's sole tropical island, long regarded as ""China's Hawaii"" for its tropical beaches, azure waters and holiday resorts.  HNA Group's statement on WeChat alt=HNA Group's statement on WeChat The airline, which stood out from its peers for its punctuality, in-flight service and new fleet, quickly expanded.  It counted financier George Soros as its largest foreign shareholder, and ventured into logistics, tourism and real estate.  By 2017, the group had ballooned into a global conglomerate with 290,000 employees.  Fuelled by bank loans and armed with money earned from its aviation business, HNA Group went shopping, raking up stakes in Hilton Hotels and Resorts, Deutsche Bank and Ingram Micro, among dozens of other brand name assets.  The acquisition spree came to an end in 2017 when China's financial regulators, fearful of risks to the banking industry, cracked down on the debt-fed binge, putting HNA Group, Anbang Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun Group under scrutiny.  Anbang, an insurer turned asset buyer - it made a failed US$13 billion bid to take over Starwood Hotels - has since been put under state ward and its former chairman thrown into jail on fraud and embezzlement charges.  Source: Various public records, SCMP alt=Source: Various public records, SCMP In February 2020, a working group comprising government officials representing the aviation regulator and Hainan provincial authorities was formed to restructure HNA Group's finances.  HNA Group had at least 1 trillion yuan (US$154. 8 billion) of assets as recently as 2017, driven by Chen's ambition for his conglomerate to make it among the Fortune 100 list of the world's largest companies by assets.  Chen has been barred from luxury spending since September last year under a court order, after a subsidiary of HNA Group failed to pay an investor in a lawsuit.  Chen was left out from a Communist Party committee that runs HNA Group this week, in a sign that he had lost control of his conglomerate after three decades at the top.

Photo: Xiaomei Chen HNA Group made headlines in Hong Kong in 2016 when it snapped up four plots of oceanfront commercial and residential land at the former Kai Tak airport for HK$27. 22 billion (US$3. 5 billion), all at a substantial premium to market valuations, outbidding the city's largest developers.  It was HNA Group's shopping in Hong Kong that began its undoing.  Hong Kong's developers, some of whom had been represented in China's top political advisory body going back decades, complained to Chinese authorities about the ""market disruptions,"" sources familiar said.  Less than two years after buying them, HNA Group had resold the last of its Kai Tak plots to Hong Kong developers.  After the government's crackdown, HNA Group reversed course and disposed of all its land in Hong Kong.  The last of the four plots was sold in 2019 for a HK$550 million loss to Wheelock and Co.  in 2019.  Besides land, HNA Group also owns Hong Kong Airlines, one of four carriers that used to be based in the city.  HNA Group's stake in Hong Kong Airlines is up for grabs, as Air China and other parties are in talks to seize control of the carrier, people familiar with the matter said last year.  Shares of Hong Kong jewellery maker Hifood, 75 per cent owned by HNA Group, are up for sale.

AP Photo/David Zalubowski, file CC BY-ND In stark contrast to the overblown fears portrayed during decades past, these days, most people think cannabis is relatively harmless.  While weed is indeed less dangerous than some other drugs, it is not without risks.  In a study published Jan.  5, my colleagues and I found that 59% percent of people using medical cannabis for chronic pain experienced moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms if they stopped ingesting weed for hours or days.  Most states in the U. S.  have legalized cannabis for medical purposes and 15 have legalized it for recreational use.  More people are using cannabis, especially older adults, and the perceived harms from weed use are steadily decreasing.  While many people report therapeutic benefits or enjoy recreational use of cannabis, it is important people understand the potential risks of cannabis use too.  What cannabis withdrawal looks like Cannabis withdrawal symptoms can include both physical and psychological experiences that emerge when someone comes down from being high or goes for a period of time without use.  When people use cannabis regularly – such as daily or nearly daily – parts of the brain become reliant on cannabinoids, the psychoactive chemicals in cannabis.  Cannabinoids are naturally produced in the body, but at a much lower level than is available in most cannabis products.  Among those who don’t use weed for a period of several hours or days, cannabinoid levels drop and they experience withdrawal symptoms.  These can including irritability, depressed mood, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, a desire or craving to use cannabis, restlessness, anxiety, increased aggression, headaches, shakiness, nausea, increased anger, strange dreams, stomach pain and sweating.  Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually go away within one to two weeks after use is stopped as the body adjusts back to its own natural production of cannabinoids.  Unlike withdrawal from some psychoactive substances – such as alcohol – cannabis withdrawal is not life threatening or medically dangerous.  But it does exist.  Cannabis withdrawal can also be quite unpleasant and people can end up continuing their cannabis use – even when they want to cut back – just to avoid experiencing withdrawal.  Regular use of cannabis can result in dependency and withdrawal when a person stops using cannabis.  AP Photo/Ted S.  Warren How common are withdrawal symptoms? To figure out how common withdrawal symptoms are, over two years, my colleagues and I repeatedly surveyed 527 people who were using medical weed for chronic pain.  We found that 59% of people who use medical cannabis for chronic pain had moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms.  The most common symptoms were sleep difficulties, irritability and anxiety.  We also found that cannabis withdrawal symptoms were more severe in younger people, people with mental health problems, people who had a longer history of cannabis use and people who used more frequently or in larger amounts.  Additionally, we found that smoking cannabis – rather than eating or topically applying it – was correlated with worse withdrawal symptoms.  Our team also looked at how people’s withdrawal symptoms changed over time.  Most continued to experience the same severity of withdrawal symptoms any time they stopped ingesting cannabis over the two years of the study, but about 10% – particularly younger people – got worse over time.  As with most dependency-forming substances, reducing the frequency or amount of cannabis use may help to alleviate these symptoms.  Our study looked at people who use medical cannabis only for pain.  But in another recent meta-analysis that included both recreational and medical use, researchers found that 47% of frequent cannabis users experience withdrawals.  Cannabis may not be the demon drug from “Reefer Madness,” but neither is it a wonder–plant with limitless upsides and no downsides.  As cannabis use increases across the U. S. , it’s important for people to understand that regular use can lead to withdrawals, and to know what those symptoms are.

Comments began appearing on the Reddit chatroom r/wallstreetbets -- the investor board now famous for fueling an astonishing short squeeze in Gamestop Corp.  that sent its market value soaring by 788% in a week.  Posters started egging each other on to pile into IShares Silver Trust, the largest silver exchange-traded fund around, saying banks have been manipulating silver prices, keeping them artificially low and masking a shortfall in physical supplies.  One post described it as “THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD. ”If this sounds all too familiar, it’s because it has been the rallying cry of conspiracy theorists in precious metals circles for decades, if not centuries.  With their constant railing against banks and big government colluding to mask inflation, it was only a matter of time before they and retail investors raging against the financial machine joined forces. To say there was a strategy may be overstating things, but the impact was felt across the markets. Small silver miners began surging first thing in the New York morning Thursday with First Majestic Silver Corp. , cited on Reddit as a short-squeeze target, soaring as much as 39%.  Then retail investors started flooding into IShares Silver Trust, driving it up by as much as 7. 2%.  Spot silver gained 6. 8% at one point, the biggest jump since August. “There’s a short squeeze going on in silver.  The ‘hoodies are all rolling into silver and the party is on,” Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures LLC in Chicago, said in a phone call.  “All those other stocks like GameStop and AMC, they’re dumping because they’ve been restricted, and they gotta go into other short opportunities and silver is an easy identifiable target. ”The economic data that came out Thursday morning, which included a larger-than-expected drop in jobless claims, have become “a moot point” for traders, Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures said by phone.  “This isn’t predicated on any global events, it’s just people on a message board putting all their guns towards the precious metals markets. ”Options markets were bid up in the frenzy, with traders and brokers seeing wide bid/ask spreads on the IShares and Comex contracts.  A record 3. 1 million IShares Silver Trust options contracts traded. “The implied volatility being quoted in the options market at this moment is wider than I’ve ever witnessed. ” James Gavilan, principal and adviser at Gavilan Commodities LLC, said in a phone interview.  “The market is factoring in large swings in the silver price, and an already illiquid market is showing extremely wide quotes for options, which means that traders are concerned about the difficulty of hedging their positions. ”To see such wide volatility spreads is “mind boggling, breath taking, it’s shocking really,” said Gavilan. The buying in silver and gold spilled over to the base metals complex on the London Metal Exchange, with copper erasing early losses, while “Chinese night desks buying” also helped the metal, according to Tai Wong, head of metals derivatives trading at BMO Capital Markets.  Copper for three-month delivery rose 0. 6% to $7,873 a ton in London.

ANU Cosmologist Dr Brad Tucker told Sky News the company was founded by a previous NASA astronaut and now “has the contracts to actually go and stay in the international space station”. A private citizen will be charged $71 million to travel to the space station for an eight-night stay. “Some of the money goes to the private company to support the endeavours and other goes to NASA to actually keep the space station ticking over,” Mr Tucker said. “What NASA is also offered this private company is they can, by 2024, build their own part of the space station and then manage it themselves. ”He said passengers would have to undergo a health screening and a 15-week training program before NASA will allow them to launch. #https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6227203473001#hVUpzK6jl

South Korea’s biggest company reported net income in the three months ended December of 6. 45 trillion won ($5. 84 billion), missing the 7. 3 trillion won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares fell 2. 2% in Seoul on Thursday. Samsung, the world’s largest maker of memory chips and displays, struck a cautious tone that stood in contrast to that of many technology companies benefiting during the coronavirus lockdowns.  Just hours earlier, Apple Inc.  and Facebook Inc.  reported financial results that handily exceed estimates. “In the first quarter, we expect overall profitability to decline due to relative weakness in the memory and display businesses,” said Ben Suh, executive vice president of investor relations, during a call with investors.  In the memory business, Samsung’s most important profit engine, “results are likely to weaken due to currency effects and continued costs associated with new fab ramp up. ”Operating profit for the semiconductor unit was 3. 85 trillion won in the fourth quarter, short of the 4. 62 trillion estimate from analysts.  The company said it expects a recovery in the business in the first half. Samsung said it’s tracking whether chip shortages that have hit the global auto industry could spill over to other sectors, including tech products. “This is a global issue,” said Han Jinman, executive vice president of the memory business.  “There is a possibility that the shortage of other semiconductor parts may impact mobile demand and so, we are carefully watching how that plays out. ”In the smartphone business, Samsung struggled in the holiday period as Apple introduced its first 5G-capable iPhones and Chinese rivals put up fierce competition.  The Cupertino, Calif. -based company took over the No.  1 position in the fourth quarter, ahead of Samsung and China’s Xiaomi Corp. , market research firms said on Thursday. With a lot of good devices on the market, “there is only so much that Samsung can grab out of it,” said Kiranjeet Kaur, research manager at IDC. Investors had anticipated Samsung could increase its dividend payout substantially, in part because the founding Lee family faces an enormous inheritance tax bill.  Instead, the company said it would continue to return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders between 2021 and 2023, although its annual dividend payout will increase slightly to 9. 8 trillion won. The results come just days after Samsung’s de-facto leader, billionaire heir Jay Y.  Lee, was sent back to prison on bribery charges.  Although professional managers lead the company’s operating units, Lee has played a central role in major strategic decisions. The company signaled it will continue to press ahead with critical deals and investments.  Samsung will use its capital to expand the capacity of its foundry business, which fabricates chips for clients like Nvidia Corp. , to meet demand and overcome current supply shortages.  It will also invest in facility expansions and “meaningful” acquisitions, the company said. “For the last few years, we have been evaluating possible M&A opportunities very carefully and have made significant progress in terms of preparation,” Choi Yoon-ho, chief financial officer of Samsung, said during the earnings call.  “Although it is difficult to pinpoint a specific timing due to uncertainties in the internal and external business environment . . .  we are optimistic of carrying out meaningful M&A activities during this term. ”Read more: Samsung Surges to New High on Strong Memory Market OutlookAnalysts including Yungsan Choi of Ebest Investment & Securities have been anticipating a long-awaited rebound in memory chip prices due to demand for servers and more powerful 5G smartphones.  Component supplier Murata Manufacturing Co.  and chipmaker MediaTek Inc.  both anticipate more than half a billion 5G handsets to be shipped this year. Chipmakers Intel Corp.  and Micron Technology Inc.  gave a bullish forecast for the first quarter of this year on continued demand for computers and phones that enable working and studying from home.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  is planning another record-breaking year of investment with as much as $28 billion set aside to expand and improve its production capacity at a time of silicon supply shortages affecting everyone from global automakers to mobile tech giants like Apple and Qualcomm Inc. Samsung’s contract chip manufacturing is expected to expand with the addition of Intel as a customer.  The two companies have discussed development and production of Intel’s mainboard chipsets over the last two years and Samsung will produce the chipset at its Austin, Texas plant starting from this quarter, Meritz Securities said in a note. Samsung Is Said to Mull $10 Billion Texas Chipmaking PlantThe existing Austin fab is capable of operating on a 14-nanometer process.  With rising expectations of growth in the foundry market, Samsung is considering building a cutting-edge logic chipmaking plant in the region that would be capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3nm in the future, Bloomberg News reported earlier. “Regarding investments including building a fab in the U. S. , we haven’t made a decision yet,” said Shawn Han, senior vice president.  “Due to the nature of foundry business that requires timely and efficient responses to customers’ demand, we routinely review capacity expansions.  We continue to study ways to optimize operations at fabs in all regions from Giheung, Hwaseong to Austin. ”(Updates with executive comment on shortages in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

And take careful note of detailed specifications including clock speeds and TDP ratings.  That’s the take away from a list of mobile RTX 30 Series GPUs acquired by ComputerBase. All told there are 28 variants representing dramatic differences in specs including TDP and clock speed across the three tiers of GPU and various vanilla and Max-Q branded models.  The overall upshot? The fastest variant of the entry-level RTX 3060 mobile GPU is comparable with the bottom end of the RTX 3080 Max-Q tier for raw graphics processing. By way of example, do the maths and the highest clocked RTX 3060 is good for 9. 3TFLOPS while the slowest 3080 cranks out 9. 6TFLOPS.  The gap is a little bigger if you compare throughput at boost clocks.  Factors like Dynamic Boost, which can add additional performance headroom, complicate matters further. But get this.  If you then compare the fastest RTX 3080 with the slowest RTX 3060, the figures are 16. 6TFLOPS and 6. 3TFLOPS.  In other words, depending on which RTX 3060 and 3080 variants you pick, the gap might be very narrow.  Or it might be 2. 5 times the raw performance. #https://www.pcgamer.com/with-28-flavours-graphics-card-names-mean-almost-nothing-for-next-gen-nvidia-gaming-laptops/#PgtrLmFHE

It truly is the ultimate smartphone, especially for photographers who want the best hardware the money can buy.  Like last year's S20 Ultra, this year's model sports a 108MP main camera sensor that promises to deliver incredibly sharp photos in daylight and low light situations thanks to its unique nona-binning technology that allows for 9 to 1 pixel binning.  The other three cameras on the back of the phone include a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, a 10x periscope telephoto camera and a final 12MP sensor paired with a 120-degree ultrawide lens that also doubles as a macro camera.  Up front, the Galaxy S21 Ultra features a 40MP selfie camera.  For video capture, Samsung has bumped up the resolution and frame rate for all five cameras to 4K/60, a first for a smartphone since most devices that feature a 4K selfie camera are limited to 30fps.  The only downside is that the phone isn't able to switch between the four different lenses on the back of the phone while recording at 4K/60, so you'll need to bump things down to 4k/30 if that's a feature that's important to you.  https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=21qJ-xYwoKA To give you an idea of what the cameras on the Galaxy S21 Ultra are capable of, we took the phone out and captured more than 100 photos and videos.  There's really a lot to like with the camera setup on the S21 Ultra since the four cameras on the back give you a lot of different options when it comes to framing your shot.  It's almost like having a DSLR with a good zoom lens with you at all times.  So far, I'm pretty impressed with the results and have not noticed any glaring issues with the images or videos that the cameras on the S21 Ultra produce.  We'll be putting together a detailed camera comparison with the Galaxy S21 Ultra and other devices like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12, and a handful of other flagship devices from 2020 to give you an idea of how Samsung's new 2021 flagship device stacks up against the competition.  Take a look at the video and photo gallery and let us know what you think of the Samsung Galaxy S21's cameras.

Remember when the mom of seven got a non-surgical facelift in January 2020? After the treatment, Braunwyn took to Instagram to share all the details on it (while still bandaged up).  In January 2021, Braunwyn let us in on more of her beauty secrets.  On January 2, Braunwyn dished on the cosmetic reason why her breasts look so good after breastfeeding seven babies.  (Spoiler alert: They're fake. ) And even more recently, Braunwyn took to social media to unveil the results from her latest treatment, which focused on her stomach.  In early January, The Real Housewives of Orange County stunner got a microneedling procedure on her stomach by Dr.  Jennifer Armstrong MD.  For those who aren't familiar with microneedling, the technique uses tiny needles to puncture the skin in order to promote collagen production.  The method tightens loose skin and improves the appearance of scars and wrinkles.  On January 18, Braunwyn shared a peek at her results with a steamy swimsuit snap.  ""5 days post [microneedling] on my tummy!!"" Braunwyn captioned the photo.  The mom of seven flaunted her fab figure in an itty bitty bikini.  The chic two-piece featured a plunging, black bandeau top and matching bottoms, which Braunwyn accessorized with gradient, oversized shades.  Photo: Braunwyn Windham-Burke/Instagram This isn't the only cosmetic treatment Braunwyn recently received.  In a video posted by Dr.  Armstrong, we got a glimpse at Braunwyn's latest clinic visit in which she got a Cynosure laser treatment and Potenza RF Microneedling.  ""I never come in here knowing what I’m going to do because I trust [Dr.  Armstrong] so much!"" Braunwyn said in the clip.

The shocking allegation was reported by Andrew MacGregor Marshall, the former Reuters bureau chief in Bangkok, in his subscription-only newsletter, Secret Siam. Marshall, who is free to quote his Thai sources without fear of the country’s vicious censorship laws since he left Asia, reports that the king is alleged to have attacked his sister after she was knocked over by his dogs.  Insiders claimed that he either jumped on her legs or beat her with a cane.  The assault was allegedly prompted after she confronted him over his plans to make his official consort a second queen, alongside his present wife, Queen Suthida. King of Thailand Allegedly Ruling His Nation From German Ski Resort With a Retinue of ConcubinesThe Thai nobility has recently been alive with rumors that King Maha X is set to elevate his official consort, Sineenat “Koi” Wongvajirapakdi, to the status of full queen.  The proposed scheme apparently went down badly with his sister, Princess Sirindhorn, who went to see her brother to try to change his mind about two weeks ago. This appears to have been a bad idea; the palace recently announced that Sirindhorn had injured both of her ankles in a fall, and had been taken to the hospital, but, MacGregor Marshall says, citing “well-placed sources” in “informed palace networks,” that this is less than half the story. In fact, he alleges, “a furious row erupted” during the meeting and “she was knocked over by one of Vajiralongkorn’s dogs, and while she was lying on the ground he either stamped on her ankles or struck them with a cane, shattering both of them. ”MacGregor Marshall says that Sirindhorn underwent operations on both ankles at Chulalongkorn Hospital and is unlikely to walk again for several months. An announcement on Koi’s promotion to Thailand’s second queen is said to have been planned for Tuesday, her birthday.  In what may be a precursor to an official announcement later, the pair made a public appearance wearing matching blue coats as they released fish and birds in a Buddhist ceremony at Wasukri pier in Bangkok.  Contrary to a report in German newspaper Bild, an official announcement of her elevation has not yet been made. If Koi is indeed promoted to the position of queen, it would mark a remarkable comeback for the 35-year-old former nurse. Koi was only released from detention in August last year after spending ten months at a correctional facility.  She had been accused of feuding with the queen but was then declared “untainted” and restored to her role as 68-year-old King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s official consort. Just as rumors of her release were circulating, over a thousand photos of her, including alleged nudes, were sent on SD cards to MacGregor Marshall, and to Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a Thai academic and outspoken critic of the monarchy. The king only married his current and fourth wife, Suthida, in May 2019, just days before his coronation.  He divorced his third wife in 2014.  The relationship was made famous by a leaked video showing her feeding birthday cake to his poodle, Fufu, while she wore only a G-string and courtiers crawled on the floor before her and the king. Fufu featured in a previous embarrassing incident: Cables written by Eric John when he was U. S.  ambassador to Bangkok, which were published by Wikileaks, detailed the king’s strange obsession with the dog.  The diplomatic cables said he adored Fufu, and gave him the title air chief marshal.  He is said to have brought the dog to an official dinner “dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts” where he drank from guests’ water glasses. Thailand is battling a deep recession brought about by COVID-19 and the collapse of the pivotal tourist trade. Opponents of the ultra-rich royal family have been emboldened in recent months as rallies by student protesters against the establishment have seen their numbers swelling. Demonstrators have recently taken to protesting by wearing crop tops exposing their midriff to mock the king, who has been photographed wearing similar garb at airports and in German shopping centers. The protests have been inflamed by reports of the king’s vast wealth, estimated by London’s Financial Times at between $30 billion and $40 billion, after sovereign funds were effectively put under his direct control by the leaders of a successful 2014 coup. He is believed to be the world’s richest king. As The Daily Beast recently reported, Vajiralongkorn is also alleged to have built up an extraordinary fleet of 38 jets and helicopters for the exclusive use of the Thai royal family. He has spent much of the past few years living in Germany, most recently at the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmish-Partenkirchen, where his retinue of 20 concubines, who have all been given the same honorary surname, have also damaged his domestic and international reputation. Email addresses provided on Thai government websites did not work, with emails from The Daily Beast requesting comment bouncing back.  However, the Thai royals do not typically comment in response to press inquiries, in part because criticizing the royal family in the media is an offense under strict lèse majesté provisions of Thai law. At the latest count, according to a tally by news agency Prachatai, at least 55 people are now facing lèse majesté charges. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

S.  Securities and Exchange Commission said it is “actively monitoring” volatility in options and equities markets amid a surge in GameStop Corp.  and other companies over the past week that prompted Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren to demand action from regulators. “Consistent with our mission to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, we are working with our fellow regulators to assess the situation and review the activities of regulated entities, financial intermediaries, and other market participants,” the SEC said in a statement Wednesday. Retail investors have rapidly driven up GameStop’s shares in recent days, squeezing hedge funds with large short positions in the company, in a twist that has grabbed attention on Wall Street and in Washington. Shares in the video-game retailer more than doubled on Wednesday, triggering at least two volatility halts as it at one point notched its biggest-ever intraday advance.  GameStop has surged eightfold in the past week, adding almost $20 billion to its market value. The moves led Warren to pressure financial regulators to crack down on Wall Street, citing the frenzied activity. In a sharply worded statement earlier Wednesday, the Massachusetts Democrat and longtime corporate foe expressed astonishment at the rally while also criticizing hedge funds and others with short positions in company. ‘Personal Casino’“For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price,” Warren said.  “It’s long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs -- and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do. ”Warren’s comments came after White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Biden’s economic team were watching stock market activity around GameStop and other heavily shorted companies. “Our team is of course -- our economic team including Secretary Yellen and others -- are monitoring the situation,” Psaki told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.  She called the trading in the video-game retailer “a good reminder, though, that the stock market isn’t the only measure of the health of our economy. ”A Treasury Department spokesperson declined to comment.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also declined to weigh in on the activity around GameStop. “I don’t want to comment on a particular company or day’s market activity or things like that.  It’s just not something really that I would typically comment on,” he told reporters at a Wednesday afternoon news conference. Read More: GameStop Rally Hits New Extremes as Short Sellers SurrenderGameStop’s meteoric rise has captivated Wall Street, as an army of small traders spurred on by Reddit posts have pushed the company’s stock price to unheard-of levels.  Shares in the company began the year at just $19.  Hedge funds that held short positions in GameStop, such as Melvin Capital, have closed out of them as the rally continued, suffering billions of dollars in losses. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, said in a tweet that Wall Street and those posting online have taken a similar approach to the economy and markets. “Gotta admit it’s really something to see Wall Streeters with a long history of treating our economy as a casino complain about a message board of posters also treating the market as a casino,” she wrote. While some commentators have cast the frenzy as a populist uprising against Wall Street institutions, others see a dangerous play that could eventually leave investors exposed to major losses.  Some wondered if it was the result of purposeful market manipulation. Earlier: Michael Burry Calls GameStop Rally ‘Unnatural, Insane’ Investor Michael Burry, who previously championed GameStop in 2019, called the current phenomenon “unnatural, insane and dangerous. ”“What is going on now -- there should be legal and regulatory repercussions,” tweeted Burry, who made his name for his bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Burry’s tweet tagged the SEC’s Division of Enforcement.

(NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC).  Government And Regulators On Volatility: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration is ""monitoring the situation"" with GameStop, although no further details were made available.  Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman discussed the extreme volatility in stocks during a CNBC ""Squawk Box"" appearance Wednesday morning.  The Nasdaq exchange has technology in place that would facilitate a halt in stocks that are mentioned across social media platforms, she said.  GameStop is listed on the NYSE.  ""If we see a significant rise in the chatter on social media channels and we also match that up against unusual trading activity — we will potentially halt that stock. "" TD Ameritrade: Twitter user @SeaSalt posted a screenshot from brokerage TD Ameritrade that states: ""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities.  We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors. "" Charles Schwab, the parent company of TD Ameritrade as part of a $22-billion acquisition, told MarketWatch that it made changes to its margin requirements.  A spokeswoman said changes to how much capital an investor can borrow were enacted Jan.  13.  The statement said the brokerage has also placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities. "" Interactive Brokers: Other users on Twitter are reporting similar restrictions at rival brokerage firms, including Interactive Brokers.  One user, Tom George, wrote a Tweet that tagged Tesla CEO Elon Musk: ""Interactive Brokers is no longer accepting orders from GME, leaving millions of retail traders stuck.

2021-01-27 20:47:01#health#A universal influenza vaccine may be one step closer, bringing long-lasting protection against flu#https://news.yahoo.com/universal-influenza-vaccine-may-one-204701648.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_eYmHd.c62_mjC5IOqUnew--~B/aD0xMDYwO3c9MTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_us_articles_815/68946e0ed9bee010aff28781dca905ea#en#-0.3818#news.yahoo.com#Wouldn't it be nice if one shot could protect you for life? Bryan R.  Smith/AFP via Getty ImagesA bad year for flu can mean tens of thousands of deaths in the U. S.  Getting vaccinated can protect you from influenza, but you have to get the shot every year to catch up with the changing virus and to top up the short-lived immunity the vaccine provides.  The vaccine’s effectiveness also depends on correct predictions about which strains will be most common in a given season.  For these reasons, a one-and-done universal vaccine that would provide lasting immunity over multiple flu seasons and protect against a variety of strains has been a long-term goal for scientists.  Researchers are now one step closer to hitting that target.  Scientists recently completed the first human trial of a vaccine created by recombinant genetic technology to fool the immune system into attacking a part of the virus that does not change so fast and is common among different strains.  I am a microbiologist interested in infectious diseases, and I’ve followed the seasonal flu epidemic for several years.  I’m excited by this news, which could mark the turning point in the quest for a universal flu vaccine.  Here’s how it all works.  3D model of an influenza virus.  Its genetic material is inside, with proteins – HA in blue, NA in red – poking out from the surface.  Smith Collection/GadoArchive Photos via Getty Images Biology of the invading influenza virus Like the virus that causes COVID-19, the influenza virus has a protein shell that is coated by a lipid membrane.  Sticking through the membrane are multiple copies of three types of proteins: haemagglutinin, abbreviated as HA; neuraminidase, abbreviated as NA; and the matrix protein, M2.  It’s the properties of the HA and NA proteins that distinguish the different strains of the virus.  You’ve probably heard of strains like H1N1 and H3N2, both of which are infecting people in the U. S.  this year.  The HA molecule is shaped a bit like a flower bud, with a stalk and a head.  Once someone inhales the virus, the tip of the HA molecule’s head binds to a receptor on the surface of the cells that line the person’s respiratory passages.  This initial binding is crucial as it induces the cell to engulf the virus.  Once inside, the virus gets to work replicating its own genetic material.  But the enzyme that copies its single-strand RNA is very sloppy; it can leave two or three mistakes, called mutations, in every new copy.  Sometimes the genetic changes are so drastic that the progeny viruses don’t survive; other times they are the start of new flu strains.  Based on viral samples collected from around the world, the flu virus that arrives one year will have about seven new mutations in the gene for HA and four in the gene for NA compared to the previous year’s virus.  These differences are a big part of why the same influenza vaccine won’t be as effective from one year to the next.  Computer illustration of an immune cell (left) releasing many antibodies (white) to attack and disable invading flu particles.  Juan Gaertner/Science Photo Library via Getty Images Fighting off a flu infection When infected with the flu virus, your immune system produces antibodies to fend it off.  Most of these antibodies interact with the HA head and prevent the virus from getting into your cells.  But there’s a downside to that strong reaction.  Because the immune response to the virus’s head is so vigorous, it pays little attention to other parts of the virus.  That means that your immune system is not prepared to fend off any future infection with a virus that has a different HA head, even if the rest of the virus is identical.  Current flu vaccines are inactivated versions of the influenza virus and so also work by inducing antibodies targeted to the HA head.  And that’s why each version of the vaccine usually works only against a particular strain.  But, as the flu spreads, the rapid rate of genetic change can produce new versions of the HA head that will evade the antibodies induced by the vaccine.  These newly resistant viruses will then render even the current season’s vaccine ineffective.  The stalk portion of the HA molecule is much more genetically stable than the head.  And HA stalks from different flu strains are much more alike than their head regions are.  So, an obvious way to protect people against different flu strains would be to use just the HA stalk in a vaccine.  Unfortunately vaccination with only a headless stalk doesn’t seem to prevent infection.  Scientists are currently pursuing several different solutions to this problem.  A new kind of flu vaccine A team of scientists led by Florian Krammer at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai just completed the first human clinical trial of what they hope will be a universal flu vaccine.  The researchers used recombinant genetic technology to create flu viruses with “chimeric” HA proteins – essentially a patchwork quilt built from pieces of different flu strains.  Volunteers for the clinical trial received two vaccinations separated by three months.  The first dose consisted of an inactivated H1N1 virus with its original HA stalk but the head portion from a bird influenza virus.  Vaccination with this virus induced a mild antibody response to the foreign head, and a robust response to the stalk.  This pattern meant that the immune systems of the subjects had never encountered the head before, but had seen the stalk from previous flu vaccinations or infections.  The second vaccination consisted of the same H1N1 virus but with an HA head from a different bird virus.  This dose elicited, again, a mild antibody response to the new head, but a further boost in response to the HA stalk.  After each vaccine dose the subjects’ stalk antibody concentrations averaged about eight times higher than their initial levels.  Researchers found that even though the vaccine was based on the HA stalk of the H1N1 virus strain, the antibodies it elicited reacted to HA stalks from other strains too.  In lab tests, the antibodies from vaccinated volunteers attacked the H2N2 virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic and the H9N2 virus that the CDC considers to be of concern for future outbreaks.  The antibodies did not react to the stalk of the more distantly related H3 viral strain.  The antibody response also lasted a long time; after a year and a half, the volunteers still had about four times the concentration of antibodies to the HA stalk in their blood as when the trial started.  Avoiding the vigorous immune response to the protein’s head means the immune cells can concentrate on the more stable stalk of the protein.  Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images Since this was a phase 1 clinical trial testing only for adverse effects (which were minimal), the researchers didn’t expose vaccinated people to the flu to test if their new antibodies protected them.  However, they did inject the subjects’ blood serum, which contains the antibodies, into mice to see if it would protect them against the flu virus.  Getting a shot of serum taken from volunteers a month after receiving the booster shot, when antibody levels were high, led to mice being 95% healthier after virus exposure than mice who got blood serum from nonvaccinated volunteers.  Even the mice who received serum that was collected from vaccinated volunteers a year after the start of the trial were about 30% less sick.  These results show that vaccination with a chimeric flu protein can provide long-lasting immunity to several different strains of the influenza virus.  Scientists will need to continue optimizing this approach so it works for different types and strains of influenza.  But the success of this first human trial means you may one day get a single shot and, at last, be free from the flu.

While these side effects are generally a minor nuisance to most people, some attempt to prevent them by taking common over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e. g. , Motrin, Advil) beforehand.  “We do not recommend premedication with ibuprofen or Tylenol before COVID-19 vaccines due to the lack of data on how it impacts the vaccine-induced antibody responses,” Dr.  Simone Wildes, an infectious disease specialist at South Shore Medical Center and a member of Massachusetts’ COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group, told ABC News. #https://www.yahoo.com/gma/avoid-preventive-pain-relievers-getting-110152625.html#s0L8gQzfg

In fact, the only two inaugurations to draw more viewers were Ronald Reagan's first inaugural in 1981, watched by 41. 8 million viewers, and Barack Obama's 2009 swearing-in, with 37. 8 million people watching.  Biden's 33. 8 million viewers easily topped Trump's 30. 6 million, Nielsen said.  More people watched Trump's inauguration on Fox News, though.  The network saw a 77 percent decline in viewers for Biden's ceremony versus Trump's.  CNN more than made up for the difference — its inaugural coverage was the No.  8 show in all of prime time last week, Nielsen said.  In the cable wars, CNN came in first last week, followed by MSNBC and then Fox News.  Trump, if he were bothered about getting lower ratings than Biden, might take a little bit of solace in the fact that more people attended his inauguration in person four years ago.

And then some? Wall Street analysts did.  A consensus sees Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) as joining that rarefied corporate crowd that’s broken the $100 billion in quarterly revenues mark when it opens the books Wednesday on its fiscal Q1.  That’s a record for AAPL, of course, and may have been assisted by holiday sales of its new iPhone 12.  But it’s one in a series of fresh peaks AAPL has scored in a year—one the company acknowledged was rocked by adversity in many corners.  Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the strong results in last quarter’s report were driven by “the unmatched loyalty of our customers. ” That may or not be true, but when AAPL reports earnings, investors also will be listening to how well AAPL is playing the market share game.  The work-from-home trend, fueled by the pandemic, looks like it might have been a game-changer for AAPL, according to Morningstar analysts who believe it powered sales of iPads, desktops, and laptops.  All that could be overshadowed in fiscal Q1 by iPhone 12 holiday sales, which it’s probably safe to say will get a fair share of attention Wednesday afternoon following the closing bell.  AAPL has always been an attention-getter when earnings season rolls around, and now, with it sporting a $2. 34 trillion market cap and reaching new stock price highs, it looks like it’s sure to take a spot under the limelight even when it’s up against a host of other high-profile tech stocks earnings results this week.  Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Facebook, Inc.  (NASDAQ: FB) report the same afternoon.  The Numbers Wall Street analysts expect AAPL revenue to jump 12% year-over-year to about $103 billion, according to FactSet.  But some firms, such as Loup Ventures, are looking for much stronger numbers: up 19% to $109. 5 billion.  From an earnings perspective, the Street has reached a consensus of $1. 41 a share.  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is also forecasting on the high side of consensus, eyeing revenues of $108. 2 billion and earnings per share of $1. 50.  “Our recent conversations suggest investors expect Apple to release solid, but not great, December quarter results,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent report.  “We disagree and believe that Apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings.  “In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple’s most successful product launch in the last five years,” they said.  More on that later.  Any way you look at it, the numbers look robust.  The Innovation Machine AAPL stopped giving guidance last year—kind of like many other companies uncertain of the ramifications of COVID-19 on their sales.  In March, no one knew what the ricochet effects of the pandemic might be or how long it might last.  We still don’t know all of that, but we have found that the city- and state-mandated quarantines and the overall fear of being in public helped fast-forward many trends that were already picking up steam.  The digital transformation sped up, and it looks like AAPL might have been well-positioned for it.  While the iPhone 12 might get most of the attention Wednesday, think back to last quarter when CEO Tim Cook noted all-time records for Mac and Services.  Though he didn’t offer guidance for this past quarter per se, he did suggest double-digit gains on all product categories except the iPhone 12, which he thought would reach single-digit gains.  FIGURE 1: APPLE LEAVES INDEX IN THE DUST.  Over the last year, shares of Apple (AAPL—candlestick) have easily outpaced the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX—purple line).  Apple shares got off to a quick start in 2021, with investors apparently enthusiastic about tomorrow’s Q1 earnings prospects.  Data source: Nasdaq.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade.  For illustrative purposes only.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  The Mighty iPhone 5G Launch Despite all the happy talk about fiscal Q4 revenues, iPhone’s weaker-than-expected sales offset the glee and pulled shares down nearly 6% in the first couple of days after the October earnings release.  They have since recovered.  AAPL reported iPhone sales of $26. 4 billion in fiscal Q4, below the $27. 73 billion expected by the Street.  Much of that shortfall was attributed to AAPL’s decision to push the iPhone 12 launch into this most recent quarter, a move many believe may have led to consumers waiting for the upgrade before they bought.  Back then, some analysts said a move to 5G could end up being a tailwind for the iPhone 12 with sales promotions and subscription services bundles.  That, combined with the important holiday shopping season about to begin, could have led to a fast start for the new phone.  We’ll see now if they were right.  Analysts are mostly bullish on their iPhone sales expectations, with some saying the delay might have pushed around $4 billion in iPhone sales to the December quarter from the fiscal Q3.  The Street’s consensus last stood at $59. 58 billion, up better than 6% on a year-over-year basis.  But Loup Ventures thinks that’s conservative.  It’s looking for sales to vault 16% on a year-over-year basis to $64. 9 billion, jumping to 59% of total sales compared with the iPhone’s typical 50% of sales standing.  It’s unclear if that will actually be the case, but if it is it would reverse a trend in recent years toward iPhones being less of AAPL’s total revenue.  The company has been emphasizing growth in services.  Remember, we’re just two years out from January 2019 when Cook sent a letter to AAPL investors warning of a fiscal Q1 earnings shortfall due in part to weak iPhone sales in China.  How things have changed.  AAPL Earnings And Options Activity AAPL is expected to report an adjusted EPS of $1. 41, up from $1. 25 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates.  Revenue is projected at $103. 01 billion, up 16. 4% from a year ago.  The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 6. 2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.  Looking at the Jan.  29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 125 and 135 strikes.  But it’s been dwarfed by activity to the upside, heavy call volume at the 145 and 150 strikes.  The implied volatility sits at the 34th percentile as of Tuesday morning.  Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Home Work And Its Tools The work- and study-from-home phenomenon helped drive sales of Macs and iPads last year, and analysts widely expect that trend continued into the fiscal Q1.  A number of bells and whistles were added to new iPads and iPad Airs, and new computers with AAPL’s custom M1 chip replacing the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) chip also hit the market.  AAPL also is reportedly working on a new iPad Pro expected to be released in mid-March.  There’s also talk on Wall Street that AAPL might have patented a new version of the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro.  Given Cook’s comments about the “most prolific product introduction period,” analysts widely expect to hear about other new products coming on line.  An update of the MacBook Air is one of those possible developments.  AAPL is working on a thinner and lighter version of the MacBook Air, Bloomberg reported late last week, citing “people with knowledge of the matter.  Analysts said they want to know if the planned release in the second half of this year is on track.  Analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.  expect AAPL to shed light on several new products and services, including how sales are going for its $549 AirPods Max over-the-ear headphones and the subscription Apple Fitness+ offering, plus ways to bundle services together for a discount.  “In our view, Apple’s portfolio was positioned better-than-ever heading into the recent holiday season, while product and service updates position Planet Apple well in 2021,” the team wrote.  And So Much More Among the myriad reasons AAPL’s earnings are such a magnet goes beyond products Other factors underscoring the company’s progress range from privacy concerns to app developer fees to government interventions and the overall economy.  AAPL has done much to address many of these issues, but each quarter tends to introduce a fresh crop.  In November, for example, AAPL said it would cut in half the commissions it charges smaller developers who sell software through the App Store and generate under $1 million in sales.  AAPL’s original 30% take has long fueled complaints from developers, users and governments over its dominance in the digital world.  The price cut to 15% appeased some but not all stakeholders and analysts hope the company will address how the cuts are panning out in the beginning weeks.  Another question heading into earnings is AAPL’s cash position.  The total cash trove stood at roughly $192 billion at the end of the company’s fiscal Q4, with about $112 billion in debt and a little more than $79 billion in cash.  AAPL returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.  Investors can expect to continue to see more of that ahead, according to Loup Ventures, which estimates an additional $73 billion will be returned in coming years.

Just you try caning Skyrim from a standing position.  In a rather obvious brand tie-up, there is now an Elder Scrolls Online-themed chair coming from Noblechairs, a company whose sedentary solutions apparently ""combine the latest ergonomics and sports-inspired design. ""(To be fair, it does look a bit sportier than this unfortunate customer.  We're still waiting to find out the reason behind the Twitch ban. )What is there to say about a chair? Perhaps now is the time to invoke the theory of forms, Plato's notion that, even if all the chairs in the world were to be destroyed, there would still remain an inviolable, timeless idea of the chair in the human mind.  All objects are mere imitations of this ideal chair.  Who is to say that this The Elder Scrolls Online is not very close to that essence, that soul of a chair?The chair is based on Noblechairs' existing HERO model, which we reckon is the best gaming chair around for back support.  This design is ""now merged with premium grade black and gold PU leather, gold stitching and high-detail embroidered artwork"" (PU or polyurethane leather is an artificial leather). You can sign up here to be notified when the chair is available.  No price is listed, but the chair type is the modestly-named HERO which usually clocks in at around $500 (as it did for an old Fallout tie-in).  Next to an Elder Scrolls wedding ring that costs a cool grand, this looks like a snip.

The new computer is planned to be released during the second half of this year at the earliest or in 2022.  It will include Apple’s MagSafe charging technology and a next-generation version of the company’s in-house Mac processors.  Apple has discussed making the laptop smaller by shrinking the border around the screen, which will remain 13-inches.  The current model weighs 2. 8 pounds and is just over half an inch at its thickest point.  The company considered building a larger version of the MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen, but Apple isn’t moving forward with this for the next generation, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. MagSafe, which was removed from the MacBook Air with its 2018 redesign, is a magnetic charging system.  That means any accidental yanking of the power cable would simply detach it from the laptop rather than pull down the entire computer.  The new model will have a pair of USB 4 ports for connecting external devices.  The new laptop is destined to be a higher-end version of the current MacBook Air, which is expected to remain in the company’s lineup as an entry-level offering.  Apple last updated the product in November with its own M1 Mac chip, replacing a processor from Intel Corp.  The Mac is Apple’s oldest product line and has a loyal following.  A few years ago, the company was criticized for not updating these computers enough and not paying attention to customer demands.  Now, there’s a flood of updates coming.  In addition to the new MacBook Air, Apple is planning its biggest update to the MacBook Pro since 2016, the first redesign of the iMac in nearly a decade, a new Intel-based Mac Pro, and a half-sized Mac Pro desktop with in-house chips. The upcoming MacBook Pro is an example of Apple’s renewed focus on Mac loyalists.  The company is planning to bring back an SD card slot for the next MacBook Pros so users can insert memory cards from digital cameras.  That feature was removed in 2016, to the consternation of professional photographers and video creators, key segments of the MacBook Pro user base.  The heavily criticized Touch Bar, the current model’s touchscreen function row, is also going.  Apple has also developed underlying Mac support for both cellular connectivity — the ability for Macs to connect to the internet via smartphone networks — and Face ID, the company’s facial recognition system.  But neither feature appears to be coming soon.  To that end, Face ID had originally been planned to arrive in this year’s iMac redesign, but it’s now unlikely to be included in the first iteration of the new design.

2021-01-26 14:05:54#business#Tesla, BMW Approved for Slice of $3.5 Billion EU Battery Aid#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-bmw-approved-slice-3-134013171.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F_o7xdbFbCeYM1V1SsTreQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/96b09f9a622d3139018f9022cf360dd0#en#0.4215#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- The European Union paved the way for companies including Tesla Inc.  and BMW AG to get about 2. 9 billion euros ($3. 5 billion) of state aid for battery projects that will strengthen the bloc’s position in the race to produce more electric vehicles. The European Commission expects the support to trigger more than three times as much private investment, bringing the total spent to about 12 billion euros.  The aid will go to 42 companies across a dozen countries, with beneficiaries also including Fiat Chrysler owner Stellantis NV and startup Northvolt AB. The 27-nation bloc plans to slash greenhouse gas emissions from transport under the European Green Deal, an ambitious economic overhaul aimed at reaching climate neutrality by 2050.  Along the way, the EU wants to reduce its reliance on EV batteries from Asian producers.  The value of Europe’s battery market will reach 250 billion euros by 2025 and meet demands from the auto industry, according to the commission. “Europe will cement in this way its position as a global hot spot for battery investment,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said.  “This pan-European project will help revolutionize the battery market. ”More information about the amount of aid going to each project will be available in the public version of the Commission’s decision once it has agreed with member states and third parties on any confidential business secrets that need to be removed. Aid for the projects, which are expected to be completed by 2028, will be disbursed by countries including Finland, Spain, France and Poland, and was coordinated by Germany.  It follows a 3. 2 billion-euro package to support a total of 9 billion euros of public and private spending that was coordinated by France and approved in December 2019. Pouring InBattery investment has poured in as Europe’s stricter pollution standards forces carmakers to embrace electric cars and limit carbon-dioxide emissions.  BloombergNEF is forecasting 1. 9 million sales of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles in Europe this year, topping China and almost quadrupling the total expected in North America. As part of the Green Deal, the EU wants to toughen its 2030 emissions-reduction target to at least 55% from 1990 levels, compared with the existing goal of a 40% cut.  The overhaul is a key pillar of the region’s strategy to recover from the virus-induced recession. European policy makers are aware the bloc’s key industries risk falling behind if they don’t fill manufacturing gaps in energy-storage technology.  Lithium-ion batteries will power plug-in cars and also help balance electric grids transmitting renewable energy including wind and solar. The battery initiative announced Tuesday got priority status as an Important Project of Common European Interest, or IPCEI.  It will involve research and development of new technologies to reduce or completely eliminate cobalt or natural graphite and replace it with synthetics. The projects will cover the entire battery value chain, from extraction of raw materials, design and manufacturing of battery cells and packs, and recycling and disposal.  The aid is expected to contribute to development of technological breakthroughs, including different cell chemistries, novel production processes and other innovations. Tesla’s AmbitionsTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the electric-car maker plans to add a battery-cell production facility at the vehicle-assembly plant it’s building near Berlin.  The site will initially have capacity of more than 100 gigawatt-hours a year and eventually ramp up to as much as 250 gigawatt-hours, Musk said during a battery conference in November. “I’m pretty confident at that point it would be the largest battery-cell plant in the world,” Musk said.  He didn’t give time frames for when he expects the facility to reach those capacity levels. The factory Tesla is building in the small town of Gruenheide will be the company’s first in Europe.  It’s slated to start making vehicle in the middle of this year and eventually assemble as many as 500,000 cars annually.  While construction is far along, the company is still awaiting final approval for the project from local authorities.  It also has been hung up by environmental groups’ legal challenges. Other carmakers investing in European battery production include PSA Group, which merged with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis.  It set up a joint venture called Automotive Cells Company with French oil giant Total SA’s Saft unit in September.  Sweden’s Northvolt will operate a plant with Volkswagen AG in Germany, with BMW also participating in the project and ordering billions’ worth of batteries from the startup. Asian battery giants including South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. , Japan’s Panasonic Corp.  and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.  Ltd.  also have said they’re going to set up or expand operations in the region.

2021-01-27 04:14:51#business#GameStop Investor Michael Burry - Of 'The Big Short' Fame - Dubs Rally 'Unnatural, Insane, And Dangerous'#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-investor-michael-burry-big-041451224.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rDgocFI6j6VwE5iRppuwHg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/7ecf3507e611483b221100253f7f00e6#en#-0.4404#finance.yahoo.com#Scion Capital founder Michael Burry on Tuesday criticized investors that have concerted to fuel a rally in the shares of game retailer GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME).  What Happened: The hedge fund manager aired his displeasure at the short squeeze on Twitter.  If I put $GME on your radar, and you did well, I’m genuinely happy for you.  However, what is going on now – there should be legal and regulatory repercussions.  This is unnatural, insane, and dangerous.  @SEC_Enforcement — Cassandra (@michaeljburry) January 27, 2021 Burry also tagged the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement arm in his Twitter post.  The physician-investor is known for “The Big Short,” a film in which he was played by Christian Bale.  The movie is based on his bet against the US housing market.  Why It Matters: Burry owned 1. 7 million GameStop shares worth $17 million at the end of September, reported Business Insider.  The shares would be now worth $250 million, which is a 1,400% increase, as of Tuesday’s close.  GameStop shares surged over 41. 5% in the after-hours session after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted “Gamestonk!!” on Tuesday.  Musk also included a link to the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets that has pushed the retailer’s shares higher and put pressure on short sellers.  See Also: GameStop's Power Surge: Will WallStreetBets Or The Short Sellers Come Out On Top? As of Tuesday’s closing, GameStop shares have returned 678. 84% since the beginning of the year, Price Action: GameStop shares closed 92. 71% at $147. 98 on Tuesday and spiked 41. 58% in the after-hours session to $209. 51.

Both vaccines produced lower levels of coronavirus antibodies than have been found in the blood of individuals who recovered from natural COVID-19 infections.  For reference, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines produced antibody levels several times higher than natural infections. The unsuccessful trials are disappointing in large part because both Merck vaccines would have required just one dose, writes Stat.  One of the candidates, which uses the same virus as the one in Merck's successful Ebola vaccine, was being developed in partnership with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which has said it will try to determine if using an oral or intranasal administration route will work better than the current intramuscular injection.  It's unclear if Merck will continue to collaborate — IAVI's president Mark Feinberg told Stat he hopes they do — because the pharmaceutical company has suggested it will now turn its focus to developing COVID-19 therapeutics. As Stat notes, the results show just how difficult vaccine development can be, especially in such a short amount of time, making the rapid success of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots seem all the more remarkable.

The company's burger patties and sausages have been among the leaders in the surge in interest in plant-based alternatives over the past two years as consumers worried about their health, animal welfare and food safety.  The new partnership will give the plant-based meat maker access to the beverage giant's distribution and marketing resources and allow it to expand into new product lines, Beyond Meat Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said. #https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-beyond-meat-partner-develop-133608887.html#cHUyBVwkU

The stock climbed as much as 32% at the open on Tuesday, putting its market capitalization at about $7 billion and making GameStop worth more than the likes of Perrigo Co. , Apache Corp. , Leggett & Platt Inc. , and Hanesbrands Inc.  It surpassed insurance-provider Unum Group, HollyFrontier Corp. , and Flowserve Corp.  on Monday. The video-game retailer has climbed about 400% this year with traders piling into the stock after activist investor and Chewy Inc.  co-founder Ryan Cohen joined its board earlier this month.  Options trading has also surged with retail investors ramping up bets on even more upside. The stock’s surge has in part been fueled by an army of Reddit-charged day traders who used the website’s WallStreetBets forum to pump up shares and fight back against the eye-popping levels of short interest.  Bets by Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital and Andrew Left’s Citron Research have faced a reckoning in the battle with GameStop’s retail fans. Hedge fund titans Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen boosted Melvin Capital, according to a statement on Monday, injecting a total of $2. 75 billion into the firm after it lost about 30% this year.  The capital infusion came after Melvin Capital, which started the year with about $12. 5 billion in assets, saw short bets, including GameStop, go awry, people familiar with the firm said.

The IRS says it needs more time to reprogram its computers based on the COVID Relief Act which wasn’t signed into law until the end of December. #https://komonews.com/news/consumer/irs-delays-start-of-tax-filing-season#aLdKyEGav

For all the transformation still undergoing Fortnite, 2017 feels like too small a distance for a game to have gone from rumored vaporware to global phenomenon.  I scored the earliest version of Fortnite a 55 at the time, a clearly troubled project that Epic Games just needed to get out after spinning its wheels in development purgatory.  Fortnite would either take on new life in the hands of players or fizzle out and die of natural causes.  It happens.  But just as the battle royale craze spun up in the wake of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' surprise success, Epic pulled an historic U-turn and put out Fortnite: Battle Royale, then a simple spin-off developed in three months.  Over time Fortnite's improvisational development helped establish a modern vocabulary for live games with in-game events, battle passes, and consistent seasonal cycles.  Fortnite saw the rise of Ninja and mainstream Twitch celebrity at large, it saw Epic try out bonkers marketing stunts like the complete shutdown of Fortnite for a few days just to generate awareness and usher in Chapter 2.  Fortnite became such a cultural, money-printing force that Epic went as far as to abandon the iOS platform as a form of protest over ""monopolistic practices,"" even accompanying the move with a parody of Apple's own 1984-inspired Macintosh ad.  And now, in 2021, Fortnite is still trucking along, still making stuff up on the fly, but it's settled into a more comfortable rhythm.  Fortnite is a battle royale toy box without a bottom, and with every recognizable character and brand waiting for their turn in the item shop.  Even if you've played before, look away for a second and Fortnite will take on a totally new look when you turn back.  So let's take a look at the state of Fortnite in 2021 and try to guess how this megagame might transform further. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-fortnite-in-2021/#SDAkTnn1r

The Schitt's Creek star shared her plans to sell the dress to the highest bidder on Jan.  21, and noted that 100 percent of proceeds will go to charity.  ""This was the very first thing I wore on my very first red carpet (the Canadian Screen Awards in 2015) so yeah, there might be anxiety sweat in the armpits, but there are pockets in the dress, so it balances out,"" she captioned an Instagram post.  ""I would very much like to sell it to you if you're in the market. "" The proceeds from the dress will be evenly split between two charities, including Encampment Support Network, a volunteer-run network that helps individuals living in tent encampments across Toronto.  Murphy will enlist the help of her followers to choose the second charity (Canadian or American) to support.  As a seasoned trend setter, Murphy knows that we shop with our eyes, but she threw in a few key details about the dress to make it even more appealing to potential bidders.  Highlights of the elegant gown include: ""It's black. "" ""It has pockets. "" ""It's made by evening wear brand Wayne Clark Designs. "" ""It is sweaty in and around the armpit area. "" ""It's a size 4. "" ""There's a big ol 'v' in the front so your skin can pop out of there. "" ""It's very nice. "" Interested in expanding your wardrobe to reflect a little more of the true style icon behind Alexis Rose? Anyone willing to donate a sizeable amount to charity can email Murphy at csadress69@gmail. com.  She'll only respond to the highest bidders, so this might be the time to gather up the gang and have everyone chip in on the most squeal-worthy of dresses, as Alexis might say.  Take a closer look at Murphy's evening gown from the 2015 Canadian Screen Awards here.

The Inquisitor stabs a knife directly into a map of the Tevinter Imperium at the end of the Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC Trespasser, for one thing, and BioWare pointed a finger in the same direction in 2020 with the release of a collection of short stories called Tevinter Nights. The writing's been on the wall.  But now, it's in an actual licensed book.  Any doubts about the location of the new game have been dispelled by the recently released BioWare: Stories and Secrets from 25 Years of Game Development, a book celebrating the studio's 25th anniversary with art, pictures, commentary, and stories.  Tom Phillips of Eurogamer scored himself a copy, and found an official confirmation inside. ""As BioWare entered its twenty-fifth year, the Dragon Age team was hard at work on Morrison, the code name of the long-awaited follow-up to Dragon Age: Inquisition,"" an entry on page 324 called ""Tevinter Bound: A sneak peek at the follow-up to Inquisition"" states. ""The game, helmed by executive producer Mark Darrah, will take players to Tevinter as the events of Inquisition and Trespasser threaten to forever change Thedas.

They’re paying up for bullish derivatives tracking the Chinese internet firm, buying thousands of January call options that expire Thursday.  The price of one Tencent contract -- which bets the stock will rise past HK$800 by expiry -- surged as much as 118,300% on Monday.  Traders also rushed to offload their bearish puts, with one of the most-traded contracts losing more than 84% in value. The stock rallied 11% on Monday to HK$766. 50, its biggest gain since October 2011.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index benchmark rose 2. 4%, closing above the key 30,000 point-level for the first time since May 2019. Tencent has become a prime target for mainland traders flooding record amounts of cash into Hong Kong-listed shares this year, with net purchase of the stock accounting for roughly a quarter of total money coming in, according to exchange data.  The buying frenzy has also boosted Tencent’s market value by about $251 billion this year, the most worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tesla Inc.  is the second-largest gainer, up $134 billion. Tencent shares now trade at nearly 40 times analysts’ estimated earnings for the next 12 months.  While that’s well above the average of 30 since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2005, it’s still below the recent peak multiple of 42 reached in 2014 and 2018.  It reached 65 at the height of China’s equity bubble in 2007. On Monday, analysts at Citigroup Inc.  lifted their target price on the firm by 19% to HK$876, the highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, citing the company’s market-share expansion and growth in the gaming sector and other digital businesses. Tencent is also getting an additional boost from taking part in the city’s fast-growing initial public offering market.  Kuaishou Technology, backed by Tencent, is seeking to raise as much as $5. 4 billion in Hong Kong in what would be the biggest internet IPO since Uber Technologies Inc. With the recent run-up, Tencent is trading at its highest price on record.  It’s largely avoided the tightening regulatory oversight that sparked a selloff in rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and forced its part-owned Ant Group Co.  to jettison a record IPO.

The secret? Run forward and shoot your gun. Speedrunner Wreak finished the level in 9 seconds on January 22nd, followed by Der_Lauch_Linus on the 23rd.  The speedy completion is due to the level's funky architecture.  The Dubai level takes place on the top floors of a skyscraper, and in the moments after the start of the level both targets are visible on balconies above Agent 47's starting point.  So you move quick, aim well, and shoot them both in seconds.  You can watch Wreak's record run here and Der_Lauch_Linus' record here.  Bonus points to Wreak for wearing a sillier costume than Linus.  These are Any% runs, which means that they simply have to complete the objectives by Speedrun. com's rules. It's not clear if you can do it in 8 seconds.  There are crucial milliseconds where Wreak or Linus are lining up their shots.  I'll bet you someone is already trying.  Meanwhile, the Silent Assassin run record is only a measly 7 seconds longer. #https://www.pcgamer.com/the-hitman-3-dubai-speedrun-record-9-seconds/#QkvPEvOyy

They added that one of the issues discussed was Iran.  * In recent days, Sullivan made calls to his counterparts in the U. K. , France, Germany, Japan and South Korea.  * The White House did not comment on the call with the Israeli national security adviser. The big picture: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned about President Biden's stated goal of trying to resume the nuclear deal with Iran.  Such a move could result in tensions between the Biden administration and the Israeli government.  * Secretary of State designate Tony Blinken said at his confirmation hearing this week that ""there is a long way"" until the Iran deal could be resumed.  * He stressed that the U.

While Taiwan has kept the pandemic well under control thanks to early and effective prevention, with the large majority of its 890 infections imported cases, it has since Jan.  12 been dealing with a small number of domestic transmissions at a hospital.  Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters that they will expand the number of people who have to quarantine at home for 14 days who may have had contact with the infected patients from the hospital cluster. #https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-put-5-000-quarantine-130047308.html#hiYiiYnM8

Social media is awash with people seeking or giving tips on how to maneuver the system.  State officials are frustrated the federal government hasn't provided more doses.  Local officials are upset Gov.  Gavin Newsom last week suddenly added the 4 million residents between ages 65 and 74 to what was supposed to be a shorter list of people first in line for shots, including health care workers and those in nursing care facilities.  Adding to the confusion is a hodgepodge of systems and differing requirements in the state's 58 counties.  For example, Los Angeles and Orange counties authorized mass vaccination sites like Dodger Stadium and Disneyland to give shots to those over 65, while San Francisco is relying largely on hospital systems to vaccinate only patients 75 and up.  Some counties are vaccinating first responders, grocery clerks and farm workers, while others are finishing up health care workers before moving to other groups.  The variety of approaches invariably means, for example, envious seniors in one part of the state are left wondering when it’s their turn as they see video of others getting shots.  Those include 73-year-old former Gov.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, who touted his inoculation at Dodger Stadium this week with a famous line from his Terminator films: “Come with me if you want to live. ” Another senior citizen, Oakland resident Sam Burd, had a frustrating week trying to get shots for himself and his wife.  He had noticed long lines snaking outside the nonprofit Asian Health Services and ran into a neighbor on Wednesday who said she had received vaccine there.  He asked for the. . . #https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Hodgepodge-systems-confusion-mar-California-15892717.php#noMhsia6Z

China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, the developer's Hong Kong-listed unit, is raising HK$26 billion (US$3. 35 billion) selling 952. 4 million new shares at HK$27. 30 each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday.  The price represents a 9 per cent discount to the last traded level on Friday, and the stake amounts to about 9. 75 per cent of its enlarged capital. Some of the richest Hong Kong and mainland tycoons have agreed to subscribe for the shares, the company said.  They include Chan Hoi-wan of developer Chinese Estate Holdings and spouse of Joseph Lau Luen-hung, as well as Liu Ming-hui, the founder of China Gas Holdings.  Each will buy HK$3 billion of stake.  The buyers have agreed to a 12-month lock-up on their shares. Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China. The stock placement shows the investors' confidence in the business prospects and can also strengthen its capital base, according to the company's filing.  It will help the Group's strategic goal of becoming ""the world's largest and most powerful new energy vehicle group,"" it added. Chinese EV makers like NIO, Xpeng, and Li Auto are rushing to catch an expected upswing in demand as China's economic rebound gains traction after growth quickened to a pre-pandemic pace of more than 6 per cent last quarter.  China is also set to become the world's biggest market for EV when 4 million cars, or one in every five vehicles, will be powered by electricity by 2025. The race to the market is preceded by a rush to build a war chest of capital.  China Evergrande NEV earlier sold 176. 6 million of new shares in September for about HK$4 billion, or HK$22. 65 each.  Earlier this month, NIO raised about US$1. 3 billion from the sale of convertible bonds, while Xpeng got US$1. 98 billion of credit lines from five mainland banking groups.  Last week, BYD announced a stock placement to raise US$3. 9 billon. China Evergrande NEV is controlled by the country's third richest tycoon Hui Ka-yan.  His plan is to raise its car production capacity to 500,000 to 1 million vehicles within three to five years, the company said on its website.  Its plants in Shanghai and Guangzhou will be capable of rolling out 200,000 units a year each at the beginning, before reaching 1 million by the fifth year, it added. The company's shares have risen 307 per cent over the past 12 months, giving it a market value of about US$34 billion despite incurring huge losses over the past two years.  The other four investors who have agreed to take up HK$5 billion each in the stock placement include businessmen from its home base Shenzhen. China Evergrande NEV intends to spend the money on technology research and development, production of new energy vehicle business and repay older debt, it said in the filing.

Dining in a restaurant might involve a tent and heat lamps, doctors appointments are conducted via telemedicine apps, and gone are the days of meandering your way through a mall.  Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has one more addition to the growing list of lifestyle changes: Staring Tuesday, you'll be required to provide evidence of a negative COVID test before flying back to the U. S.  from any international destination. ""If you plan to travel internationally, you will need to get tested no more than 3 days before you travel by air into the United States (US) and show your negative result to the airline before you board your flight, or be prepared to show documentation of recovery,"" reads the new policy, which was posted to the CDC's website on Jan.  23. As the new policy mandates, airlines must refuse to board anyone who fails to provide a negative COVID test result.  This could very well disrupt travel plans for some, but should help to minimize potential exposure for those flying, as well as the broader public. According to David Cutler, MD, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, the CDC's new policy has arrived not a moment too soon.  As he explains, the ""recently increased ability of COVID to pass from person to person is making air travel and all activities more risky for contracting this disease. ""Longer flights already pose a risk that experts say is incalculable at this time.  Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), said in a recent interview that shorter flights may be safe due to HEPA filter use for ""modest duration flights,"" but for long, international flights, ""all bets are off. ""It is impossible to say how safe airline travel might be,"" agrees Cutler.  ""It is important to recognize that anyone around you could transmit COVID to you.  And you could pass it on to others. ""If you must fly, read on for some expert-approved tips on how to do it as safely as possible.  And for the masks you shouldn't wear while flying or in any other situation, check out The CDC Warns Against Using These 6 Face Masks.  1 Skip the flight if you have symptoms.  Just because you get a negative test doesn't necessarily mean you're in the clear.  If you present with any of the typical COVID symptoms, you should seriously consider postponing your flight—even if your test has not confirmed your case. According to the MD Anderson Center at the University of Texas, rapid antigen tests are less accurate than PCR tests at spotting the virus.  And while the CDC doesn't require any particular test type, the three-day window will mean most travelers will use rapid tests, which can deliver results in as little as a half an hour, rather than the two to five days that it takes to get PCR test results. ""To a certain degree, you're sacrificing accuracy with speed.  By their very nature, the antigen style tests aren't as sensitive because they require a larger amount of virus present to be positive,"" explains the MD Anderson website.  ""Someone with a positive test by this style of test should be treated as infected with COVID-19, but a negative test is less reliable and may need to be confirmed. "" And for more regular COVID updates, sign up for our daily newsletter.  2 Be vigilant before you board.  According to Cutler, the risk of flying isn't limited to your flight time.  ""The risk of air travel also includes the risks of transport to the airport,"" along with the time spent navigating airport lines and crowds, he says. ""It is impossible to measure the risk you may be exposed to in these crowded, uncontrolled environments.  That is why travel causes transmission of COVID and why one of the first steps in controlling the pandemic was limiting travel in those countries which effectively reduced the number of cases and deaths,"" Cutler explains.  And for more on how COVID is spreading, see why You're More Likely to Get COVID From Someone Doing This Than From Coughing.  3 Take precautions while using the airport bathroom.  Cutler also suggests exercising additional caution if you need to use the restroom while in the airport or aboard your flight.  These are high-traffic areas that often have questionable ventilation, and while most airports have stepped up their cleaning regimens amid the pandemic, bathrooms can still pose a heightened threat to travelers. If you do use the bathroom facilities, be sure to wear your mask, limit what you touch by using clean paper towels to operate faucets and doors, and wash and sanitize your hands thoroughly afterward.  And for one thing you don't have to do anymore, check out The One Thing You Can Stop Doing to Avoid COVID, CDC Says.  4 Wear a medical grade mask and face shield.  While on board your flight, Cutler explains that your main concern should be mitigating risk from those seated nearest to you.  ""The ventilation systems on commercial airliners contain HEPA air filters which effectively remove nearly any viral particles,"" Cutler explains.  ""Several small studies have confirmed that the majority of the risk while flying comes from the people immediately around you. ""Luckily, you can slash that risk by coming prepared with the right gear, and by optimizing ventilation.  ""That risk can be minimized by wearing an N95 mask and face shield.  You should also turn your overhead air blower on high to push as much clean air at you as possible,"" Cutler advises.  And for more on mask safety, know that If You're Still Doing This, Your Mask Isn't Protecting You, Study Says.

The 1. 3 update will release on February 3rd, and is split into four events: All That Glitters, Lantern Rite Tales, Theater Mechanicus, and the Xiao Market.  Theater Mechanicus is a tower defense battle where players use a gridded arena to place down towers, then fight alongside them against enemy waves.  The new character Xiao, a 5-star, is at the center of much of the update trailer and will receive a story quest to go with him.  Players will get a raftload of free materials in the update, like rate-up wishes and a mini-event that gives out a free 4-star character from the Liyue crew: Xiangling, Xinyan, Beidou, Ningguang, Xingqu, and Chongyun.  There's also an event coming based on the in-game photo mode, with rewards for well-composed shots.  The other mini-events are a mode based around Geovishap mini-bosses and a Geovishap world boss, and a Ley Line update that gives double loot for the first three Ley Lines each day. Additionally, starting now and lasting until the end of January, an online slime festival game lets you get some bonuses in Genshin proper by making slimes happy.  It's adorable—you can find those details here. We considered Genshin Impact, a free-to-play open world RPG out of China, to be one of 2020's biggest and most pleasant gaming surprises.  The new update will also include some fixes for the resin problem.  You can watch the full English livestream of the update reveal below. #https://www.pcgamer.com/genshin-impact-13-comes-in-february-but-an-adorable-slime-festival-is-out-now/#ToGuSi8MZ
