Catalina Lauf, who served in the Department of Commerce under the Trump administration, launched a bid Thursday to oust Kinzinger from his seat in the 16th congressional district of Illinois.  “I never thought I’d primary a fellow Republican, but is Congressman Kinzinger really a Republican anymore? He isn’t and we have the proof,” the 27-year-old challenger said in a campaign announcement video.  Lauf said her 42-year-old opponent is a “weak-kneed, establishment Republican” who “cares more about his next MSNBC appearance than the voters who elected him. ” She claimed Kinzinger does not support the “America First” movement, noting his “one in three votes” in Congress that have sided with House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D. , Calif. ) “Instead of being in our fight, Adam betrayed his constituents for a life in the D. C.  swamp,” said Lauf, who branded herself the “anti-AOC. ” She blasts her “Fake Republican” opponent for backing the “phony impeachment hoax for a president who has already left office. ” “He said impeachment was ‘necessary to save America. ’ What?” Lauf said.  “You know what I think is necessary to save America, Adam? Setting term limits for people like you and the rest of your friends out.  Six terms in Congress is enough. ” Kinzinger is one of ten House Republicans who supported Trump’s impeachment on the charge of “incitement of insurrection” after a mob of the former president’s supporters stormed the U. S.  Capitol last month.  Others who supported impeachment, including Representative Liz Cheney (R. , Wyo. ) and Representative Anthony Gonzalez (R. , Ohio), are likely to face primary challenges from pro-Trump Republican candidates as well.  Gonzalez is expected to face a primary challenge from a former Trump aide, Max Miller, who served in the White House.  Miller has reportedly been in discussion with top Republican donors in Ohio and other Republican leaders since leaving the White House last month, according to Politico.  Miller, who is from northeastern Ohio, recently purchased a house in Rocky River, which is inside Gonzalez’s 16th district, according to the report.  As for Lauf, she says she will focus on a number of issues, if elected, including “social media censorship,” “election integrity,” “freedom of speech,” “gun rights,” “illegal immigration,” and “keeping the economy going. ” Lauf is the daughter of a Guatemalan immigrant mother and a small-business-owner father.  This marks Lauf’s second bid for Congress, having run in the 14th congressional district of Illinois in 2020.  State senator Jim Oberweis beat out Lauf in a crowded primary to become the GOP candidate, but ultimately lost in the general election against incumbent representative Lauren Underwood, a Democrat, by less than 2 percent. #https://news.yahoo.com/former-trump-aide-run-primary-133040029.html#PLU2m8W9x

When the retro game rescue crew at Nightdive first launched the Kickstarter campaign to remake System Shock in 2016, the studio ambitiously thought it could be finished in a year and a half.  That didn't happen, and early in 2018, the game far from done, they made the dramatic move of restarting from scratch, after straying too far from the original idea of a faithful remake. Three more years in, it's nearly finished: Pre-orders are available starting Thursday, and Nightdive's head of business development Larry Kuperman told me the launch isn't far off.  The plan is for System Shock to be out this summer.  A new demo, available for everyone to download today, represents a game that's finally almost at the finish line. The goal of the demo is to present a ""feature-complete version of the game,"" says CEO Stephen Kick, so players ""understand exactly what they'll be getting if they preorder. "" Kick walked me through what the demo includes that we haven't already seen from Nightdive's remake so far. ""Those features include a dismemberment system, so you'll be able to blow apart the mutants and cyborgs that are onboard Citadel Station,"" he said.  ""The lighting is now fully real-time so you'll be able to destroy the lights.  We wanted to make it as immersive as possible.  One of the other really big features that's available for the first time is cyberspace.  You can go into cyberspace, fight the various enemies that are there, and unlock doors that are in the real world that are protected by SHODAN in virtual reality. ""The demo also has new voice acting, more detailed environments, and dynamic music that will change out sections of a track rather than run on a loop.  It's more advanced than the original game's, and the new soundtrack will definitely have its own vibe, too. ""The original had a dynamic system that would change based on whether you were in combat or exploring.  We have that, we've recreated that, but the tone of the music has definitely changed,"" said Kick.  ""When you're exploring it's a lot more atmospheric, and not so much like you're in a '90s rave. ""But don't worry—parts of the System Shock remake's soundtrack will still be danceable.  Artist Evelyn Mansell pointed out that cyberspace is pretty ravey.

The average U. S.  price of regular-grade gasoline jumped 14 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $2. 64, according to the Associated Press.  The price at the pump has climbed 46 cents since Nov.  20.  Some of the rise this past week was attributable to the deep freeze in the South, which temporarily shut down production at about a dozen refineries in and around Texas.  Resumption of production there could bring some temporary relief, but the long-term outlook is not as rosy. #https://fox8.com/news/analysts-say-gas-prices-of-3-per-gallon-is-real-possibility/#UcWgxytTf

AP Photo/Evan VucciThe Biden administration and Congress are fast-tracking a US$1. 9 trillion coronavirus package that includes aid for states, cities, individuals, the unemployed, schools and much else.  It could become law within weeks.  But is it stimulus or relief? If you’ve been reading stories on the legislation, you’ll frequently see it called one or the other – or sometimes both.  The White House calls it a “rescue plan,” while an economist might dryly refer to it as a “fiscal” package.  What does it matter? As a macroeconomist who focuses on growth, I would argue it both matters – and it doesn’t.  On one level it’s semantics, or politics, but there’s also a fundamental question about what really ails the economy – and what the right remedy is.  It’s a relief A macroeconomy – that is, the overall economy, not individual businesses or industries – is made of two basic components: aggregate supply and aggregate demand.  Aggregate supply represents the quantity of goods and services an economy can produce, while aggregate demand represents how much consumers and businesses are willing to spend on those products.  When an economic crisis strikes, the problem is usually considered one or the other: Either the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services has been curtailed, or something reduced the willingness of consumers and businesses to buy stuff.  More rarely, it can also be both.  Economists consider a relief package the right solution when the crisis affects primarily supply.  When much of the U. S.  economy shut down a year ago, for example, the pandemic recession felt very much like a so-called supply shock, as many businesses had to close their doors and stop providing goods and services.  So economists and policymakers assumed the economy’s primary need was aid to tide over companies and workers until the crisis passed.  That’s why the 2020 coronavirus bills were generally seen as aimed at providing relief – in the form of supplemental unemployment benefits, individual checks and grants to small businesses to keep workers on their payroll – not stimulus.  The Associated Press style guide, effectively a bible for journalists about word usage, explicitly advises reporters covering March’s $2. 2 trillion coronavirus relief bill: “Do not refer to it as a stimulus.  … The measure was passed to replace money lost in the collapse of the economy, rather than to stimulate demand. ” So if the economy’s underlying problems concern supply, the main goal is to shore up industries, businesses and individuals most affected until they can get back to work, which, most people at first assumed, was just a matter of time.  The Paycheck Protection Program, which gave forgivable loans to businesses affected by COVID-19 lockdowns last year, is a good example of this approach.  Or is it stimulating A stimulus, as the name implies, is meant to stimulate the macroeconomy.  It begins with the assumption that what ails the economy is a lack of demand for goods and services.  The idea, first proposed by British economist John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression, is that an economy is unlikely to recover on its own unless the government jump-starts spending, stimulating consumer and business demand.  One recent example of government stimulus is the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in 2009 during the Great Recession.  Economists broadly consider it stimulus, and it was split between tax cuts, spending on unemployment and education, and infrastructure investment.  A stimulus bill, first and foremost, is meant to get consumers to spend and businesses to invest.  It can accomplish this by cutting taxes, injecting money into the economy or investing in what were referred to in 2009 as “shovel-ready” infrastructure projects.  Depends on the crisis So that raises the question, what kind of economic crisis are we in now? To some extent, it’s delivered a shock to both supply and demand and has affected different parts of the economy in very divergent ways.  Some companies, like Amazon, are doing great, while others, such as airlines and hotels, are doing terribly.  And employees with professional jobs who can work from home over Zoom are doing fine, while many lower-paid service workers are among the hardest hit.  January’s jobs report shows the dual track.  The main unemployment rate fell to 6. 3%, significantly down from 14. 8% last April.  At the same time, the number of unemployed describing their job loss as “permanent” is declining more slowly and remains three times its pre-pandemic level.  And the number of long-term unemployed has been increasing.  Moreover, the 6. 3% headline rate measures only people actively looking for work and leaves out millions of Americans who have given up looking for work or are underemployed.  Taken together, these numbers indicate that a large number of people are not expecting to get back to work anytime soon and will need more than just a little help to tide them over.  This situation makes the case for a large, broad-based package – something like the Biden proposal – that both provides relief but also stimulus to create the demand for new jobs and to draw the long-term unemployed back into the job market.  Some have grown alarmed about the amount of money the government will spend, however, and worry that it’ll stimulate too much and spur inflation.  Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, for example, says the so-called output gap – the difference between what the U. S.  economy is currently producing and what it is capable of producing – isn’t all that big, which could mean the size of Biden’s package will drive up prices without really generating new economic activity.  [Deep knowledge, daily.  Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter. ] You say potato, I say stimulus To some extent, these definitions may be distinctions without a difference.  Even a narrowly tailored relief package would have some stimulative effect on the economy.  All those “economic impact” checks the government sent out in 2020 were meant as relief, but they had a significant stimulating impact as well.  To the extent that a program gets people spending more, it is a stimulus.  To the extent that the same program leads to job creation for the unemployed, it is a relief package.  Ultimately, the word matters less than the impact.  And economists in the White House, Federal Reserve and academia like me will be tracking it closely.

When exactly those films arrive has yet to be determined, as the COVID-19 pandemic has repeatedly pushed back the release slates of dozens of blockbusters.  But for now, “A Quiet Place II,” which was originally set for release in March 2020, is set for release in theaters on September 17, while “MI7” is set for release in theaters on Nov.  19.  Paramount’s announcement comes as the pandemic has led Hollywood studios to experiment with the theatrical window that has been fiercely defended by movie theaters for decades.  Universal Pictures has signed a deal with AMC Theaters and Cinemark to release its films on PVOD as early as 17 days after theatrical release, or 31 days if the film grosses more than $50 million in its opening weekend.  Also Read: Here's Everything ViacomCBS Just Announced Is Coming to Paramount+ Warner Bros. , meanwhile, made the controversial decision to release all of its 2021 films on HBO Max for 30 days at the same time they are release in theaters.  Disney is also experimenting with the theatrical window, placing its animated film “Raya and the Last Dragon” in both theaters and on PVOD for Disney+ subscribers on March 5.  Paramount has sold distribution rights to several streaming services over the course of the pandemic, including Aaron Sorkin’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7” to Netflix and Eddie Murphy’s “Coming 2 America” to Amazon Studios.  But the studio has held on to its biggest tentpoles, delaying them in the hopes that theaters will be able to reopen this fall and allow the films to earn a strong return at the box office.  Combined, “A Quiet Place” and “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” grossed over $1. 1 billion worldwide during a resurgent box office year for Paramount in 2018, and the sequels, along with “Top Gun: Maverick” are part of the studio’s plan to rebound after struggles in 2019 and 2020.

The revenue for these support contracts is deferred and typically recognized over a period of time after the Coriant acquisition, so Infinera's GAAP revenue for a period of time after the acquisition will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value.  The non-GAAP adjustment eliminates the effect of the deferred revenue write-down.  Management believes these adjustments to revenue from support contracts assumed in the Coriant acquisition are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue trends in Infinera's business.  (2)Other customer-related charges include one-time benefits and charges that are not directly related to Infinera’s ongoing or core business results.  During the second quarter of 2019, Infinera agreed to reimburse a customer for certain expenses incurred by them in connection with a network service outage that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.  Management has excluded the impact of this charge in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring, and management believes that this reimbursement is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.  (3)Stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation effective January 1, 2006.  The following table summarizes the effects of stock-based compensation related to employees and non-employees (in thousands): Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December26, 2020 September26, 2020 December28, 2019 December26, 2020 December28, 2019Cost of revenue $1,742 $1,878 $1,752 $7,785 $6,449 Total Cost of revenue 1,742 1,878 1,752 7,785 6,449 Research and development 4,501 4,209 3,574 16,863 17,457 Sales and marketing 2,771 2,706 2,578 10,907 8,413 General and administration 3,905 3,270 3,169 13,906 10,460 Total Operating expenses $11,177 $10,185 $9,321 $41,676 $36,330 Total stock-based compensation expense $12,919 $12,063 $11,073 $49,461 $42,779 (4)Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of developed technology, trade names, customer relationships and backlog acquired in connection with the Coriant acquisition.  Amortization of acquired intangible assets also consists of amortization of developed technology, trade names and customer relationships acquired in connection with the Transmode AB acquisition.  U. S.  GAAP accounting requires that acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives.  As this amortization is non-cash, Infinera has excluded it from its non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses and net income measures.  Management believes the amortization of acquired intangible assets is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (5)Acquisition and integration costs consist of legal, financial, IT, manufacturing-related costs, employee-related costs and professional fees incurred in connection with the Coriant acquisition.  These amounts have been adjusted in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that these expenses are non-recurring, not indicative of ongoing operating performance and their exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (6)Business combination accounting principles require Infinera to measure acquired inventory at fair value.  The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’s cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin.  The non-GAAP adjustment to Infinera's cost of sales excludes the amortization of the acquisition-related step-up in carrying value for units sold in the quarter.  Additionally, in connection with the Coriant acquisition, cost of sales excludes a one-time adjustment in inventory as a result of renegotiated supplier agreements that contained unusually higher than market pricing.  Management believes these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect ongoing cost of sales and gross margin trends of Infinera's business.  (7)Restructuring and related costs are primarily associated with the reduction of operating costs, the closure of Infinera's Berlin, Germany site, the reduction of headcount at Infinera's Munich, Germany site and other sites, and Coriant's historical restructuring plan associated with its early retirement plan.  In addition, this includes accelerated amortization on operating lease right-of-use assets due to the cessation of use of certain facilities.  Management has excluded the impact of these charges in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results as they are non-recurring in nature and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (8)COVID-19 related costs consist of higher replacement costs associated with certain warranty parts customers were unable to return for repair due to logistics issues and mobility issues related to COVID-19 public health mandates and restrictions.  In addition, Infinera needed to source certain key components from an alternate supplier at substantially higher cost in order to fulfill delivery commitments in the normal course of business.  Management has excluded these expenses from non-GAAP financial measures because they were caused by atypical circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic, as their exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (9)Litigation charges are associated with the preliminary settlement of a litigation matter agreed to during the quarter ended June 29, 2019.  Management has excluded the impact of this charge in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring and management believes that this expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.  (10)Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's non-convertible debt borrowing rate.  Accordingly, for GAAP purposes, Infinera is required to amortize as debt discount an amount equal to the fair value of the conversion option that was recorded in equity as interest expense on the $402. 5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2. 125% convertible debt issuance in September 2018 due September 2024 and $200 million in aggregate principal amount of 2. 50% convertible debt issued in March 9, 2020 due March 2027.  Interest expense has been excluded from Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (11)Management has excluded the gain on the sale related to non-marketable equity investments in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring, and management believes that this income is not indicative of ongoing operating performance (12)The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is due to the net tax effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.  (13)Non-GAAP EPS as adjusted did not exclude the impact of foreign currency.  Had the impact of foreign currency been excluded for the three months ended December 26, 2020, September 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, non-GAAP EPS as adjusted would have been $0. 08, loss of less than one cent, and $0. 02, respectively, and for the twelve months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, non-GAAP EPS as adjusted would have been $(0. 19) and $(0. 57), respectively.  (14)The non-GAAP diluted shares include the potentially dilutive securities from Infinera's stock-based benefit plans excluded from the computation of dilutive net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  These potentially dilutive securities are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when Infinera has net income on a non-GAAP basis.  During the three months ended December 26, 2020, the Company included the dilutive effects of the 2027 Notes in the calculation of diluted net income per common share as the average market price was above the conversion price of the Notes.  The dilutive impact of the Notes was based on the difference between the Company's average stock price during the period and the conversion price of the Notes.

House of Representatives will hear testimony on Wednesday from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and other officials as lawmakers consider significant reforms to tackle the precarious finances of the U. S.  Postal Service (USPS).  Delays in paychecks and other mail deliveries by USPS gained attention this summer as a record number of voters mailed in ballots to elect a new president.  DeJoy, a supporter of former President Donald Trump appointed to head the USPS last year, suspended operational changes in August after enormous criticism over postal delays. #https://www.yahoo.com/news/congress-weigh-reforms-u-postal-110251968.html#Bu1C0EfFX

WFAM is the asset management unit of the bank, with $603 billion in assets under management and specialized investment teams with more than 450 investment professionals.  The deal is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021.  Per the terms of the transaction, Wells Fargo (WFC) will continue to serve as a client and distribution partner, holding a 9. 9% equity interest.  Wells Fargo’s Wealth & Investment Management division CEO Barry Sommers said, “Operating as an independent firm as a portfolio company of GTCR and Reverence Capital will provide numerous benefits to WFAM’s clients, employees, and strategic partners — including Wells Fargo. ” (See Wells Fargo stock analysis on TipRanks) “At the same time, this transaction reflects Wells Fargo’s strategy to focus on businesses that serve our core consumer and corporate clients, and will allow us to focus even more on growing our wealth and brokerage businesses,” he added.  On Feb. 18, J. P.  Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja upgraded the stock to Hold from Sell and increased the price target to $37 from $31. 50 following “news reports that the Federal Reserve accepted the company’s plan to overhaul its risk management and compliance, which is a critical step on the path to eventual lifting of the asset cap. ” Juneja believes the company’s “valuation is appropriate after factoring in potential earnings benefit from lifting of the asset cap plus sizable cost savings from its restructuring. ” However, the analyst said, “there is still much uncertainty about the full earnings run rate and profitability once the restructuring is completed. ” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating.  That’s based on 11 analysts suggesting a Buy and 8 analysts recommending a Hold.  The average analyst price target of $36. 63 implies 1% downside potential to current levels.

2021-02-23 21:55:09#tech#The development of Dying Light 2 has been 'total chaos,' according to report#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-development-of-dying-light-2-has-been-total-chaos-according-to-report/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qR99xjfDtqMDwMzzmUtXA5-1200-80.jpg#en#0.0#www.pcgamer.com#"Dying Light 2 has had its share of struggles since it was announced almost three years ago at E3 2018.  Developer Techland made some very big promises regarding the impact of individual player choice on gameplay and outcomes, which would demand multiple playthroughs for anyone who wanted to see more than half of the content it offered.  But a planned release for spring 2020 was missed, and a new release date hasn't been set.  The game also lost its lead writer, Pawel Selinger, who departed earlier this year after more than 20 years at the studio. A new report on Techland published by TheGamer suggests that the project may be floundering largely due to problems at the studio, particularly regarding the ""autocratic"" management style of CEO Pawel Marchewka.  Interviews with ten current and former employees allege problems including an over-reliance on external consultants who lack experience in the games industry (whose advice is often ignored anyway), conflict at the production level, a high rate of staff turnover, and micromanagement that some developers characterized as ""the eye of Sauron,"" which has collectively had the effect of stripping the game of a ""coherent vision. ""Techland has a history of hiring people for which the team had 'high hopes,' but it ended up in nothing,"" one source said.  ""One such case for the designers was the hiring of Marc Albinet, a former game director from Ubisoft, that was supposed to restructure how design is done in the studio.  Even he, a veteran with 30 years of experience, couldn't break through upper management that is harder to change than the spin of the fucking Earth. ""New hires and consultant who don't follow the company line end up sidelined, according to another source, which ultimately leads to their resignation or termination: ""To make a career at Techland, you have to be subservient. ""Techland's insistence on using its own internal technology to power the game is also a stumbling block, according to some employees.  Dying Light uses the Chrome Engine, a proprietary 3D engine developed by Techland, but after the first game was released the chief development officer at the time, Pawel Zawodny, wanted development of the sequel to be iterated in a more widely used engine, like Unreal or Unity, before bringing their work to the Chrome Engine.  Marchewka, however, insisted on everything being done in Chrome Engine 6. ""It slowed everyone down and that frustrated everyone,"" a source told TheGamer.  ""He would ask why people aren't working faster and it was because the tech isn’t up to speed.  We can work faster, but we have to go here, and you're not allowing us to go there.  The experts know what the goal is, and they should be allowed the flexibility to do what’s best. ""Zawodny, who now heads up CD Projekt Red's Wroclaw studio, brought on consultants of his own to help build a more conventional workflow, but many of their suggestions were apparently not adopted.  The system as it currently stands, one employee told TheGamer, is ""a production pipeline that changes so quickly and rapidly that it might as well not exist. "" More producers have been hired to help get the wheels turning, but reportedly often find their efforts blocked be veteran employees. The report touches on a range of other issues, such as producers interfering in design decisions—one source said producers on Dying Light 2 ""cannot hold the pipeline or milestones together, but they [have] time to redesign or argue about design""—and constant micromanagement from upper management, which collectively points to an atmosphere of chaos and aimlessness at the studio, and on Dying Light 2. ""What is going on in Techland is just total chaos, not iteration,"" a source said.  ""There are plenty of examples where there is someone responsible for a given feature—like a game director decides on something—but Pyza [creative director Adrian 'Pyza' Ciszewski] and Marchewka just overwrite this because of some bullshit reason, like they've seen something working differently in other games so we can do it like that. ""Marchewka defended the studio and its processes, saying that ""trust and the flow of ideas in a large organization is a complex issue. ""We are currently working on creating an innovative game that millions of players around the world will love, and thus we are constantly looking for methods that allow us to improve the transmission of fresh and interesting ideas,"" he said.  ""However, not every idea is a good idea for this project, and only the best and consistent ones with the vision of the project will be implemented in our game. ”Unfortunately, there's still no sign of a Dying Light 2 release date: Techland said in January when it confirmed Selinger's departure that it would ""be sharing exciting news about Dying Light 2 soon,"" but as of now there's been no sign of what that news might be.  I've reached out to Techland for comment, and will update if I receive a reply. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-development-of-dying-light-2-has-been-total-chaos-according-to-report/#BXodmttyB

This could see the machines fail in less than two years, if the numbers are correct, and while this really is a worst-case scenario, it still paints a worrying picture about the longevity of the new machines.  Something compounded by the fact that the SSDs are soldered on the mainboards, which means replacing them isn't straightforward. Core to what's going on is the way in which SSDs work, specifically the number of writes they can reliably support.  The flash memory on the drives can only be written to a certain number of times before becoming unstable.  There are plenty of systems in place to spread the load across all the memory cells, but essentially there's a point where the drive has been written to so many times that it can no longer reliably hold the information. This is all summed up by the Total Bytes Written figure, measured in terabytes (which is why it's also referred to as Terabytes Written).  This needs to be considered in the context of the length of the warranty, which is generally five years. #https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-m1-macs-appear-to-be-chewing-through-their-ssds/#noV94HdfR
