The revenue for these support contracts is deferred and typically recognized over a period of time after the Coriant acquisition, so Infinera's GAAP revenue for a period of time after the acquisition will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value.  The non-GAAP adjustment eliminates the effect of the deferred revenue write-down.  Management believes these adjustments to revenue from support contracts assumed in the Coriant acquisition are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue trends in Infinera's business.  (2)Other customer-related charges include one-time benefits and charges that are not directly related to Infinera’s ongoing or core business results.  During the second quarter of 2019, Infinera agreed to reimburse a customer for certain expenses incurred by them in connection with a network service outage that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.  Management has excluded the impact of this charge in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring, and management believes that this reimbursement is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.  (3)Stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation effective January 1, 2006.  The following table summarizes the effects of stock-based compensation related to employees and non-employees (in thousands): Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December26, 2020 September26, 2020 December28, 2019 December26, 2020 December28, 2019Cost of revenue $1,742 $1,878 $1,752 $7,785 $6,449 Total Cost of revenue 1,742 1,878 1,752 7,785 6,449 Research and development 4,501 4,209 3,574 16,863 17,457 Sales and marketing 2,771 2,706 2,578 10,907 8,413 General and administration 3,905 3,270 3,169 13,906 10,460 Total Operating expenses $11,177 $10,185 $9,321 $41,676 $36,330 Total stock-based compensation expense $12,919 $12,063 $11,073 $49,461 $42,779 (4)Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of developed technology, trade names, customer relationships and backlog acquired in connection with the Coriant acquisition.  Amortization of acquired intangible assets also consists of amortization of developed technology, trade names and customer relationships acquired in connection with the Transmode AB acquisition.  U. S.  GAAP accounting requires that acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives.  As this amortization is non-cash, Infinera has excluded it from its non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses and net income measures.  Management believes the amortization of acquired intangible assets is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (5)Acquisition and integration costs consist of legal, financial, IT, manufacturing-related costs, employee-related costs and professional fees incurred in connection with the Coriant acquisition.  These amounts have been adjusted in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that these expenses are non-recurring, not indicative of ongoing operating performance and their exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (6)Business combination accounting principles require Infinera to measure acquired inventory at fair value.  The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’s cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin.  The non-GAAP adjustment to Infinera's cost of sales excludes the amortization of the acquisition-related step-up in carrying value for units sold in the quarter.  Additionally, in connection with the Coriant acquisition, cost of sales excludes a one-time adjustment in inventory as a result of renegotiated supplier agreements that contained unusually higher than market pricing.  Management believes these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect ongoing cost of sales and gross margin trends of Infinera's business.  (7)Restructuring and related costs are primarily associated with the reduction of operating costs, the closure of Infinera's Berlin, Germany site, the reduction of headcount at Infinera's Munich, Germany site and other sites, and Coriant's historical restructuring plan associated with its early retirement plan.  In addition, this includes accelerated amortization on operating lease right-of-use assets due to the cessation of use of certain facilities.  Management has excluded the impact of these charges in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results as they are non-recurring in nature and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (8)COVID-19 related costs consist of higher replacement costs associated with certain warranty parts customers were unable to return for repair due to logistics issues and mobility issues related to COVID-19 public health mandates and restrictions.  In addition, Infinera needed to source certain key components from an alternate supplier at substantially higher cost in order to fulfill delivery commitments in the normal course of business.  Management has excluded these expenses from non-GAAP financial measures because they were caused by atypical circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic, as their exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (9)Litigation charges are associated with the preliminary settlement of a litigation matter agreed to during the quarter ended June 29, 2019.  Management has excluded the impact of this charge in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring and management believes that this expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.  (10)Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's non-convertible debt borrowing rate.  Accordingly, for GAAP purposes, Infinera is required to amortize as debt discount an amount equal to the fair value of the conversion option that was recorded in equity as interest expense on the $402. 5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2. 125% convertible debt issuance in September 2018 due September 2024 and $200 million in aggregate principal amount of 2. 50% convertible debt issued in March 9, 2020 due March 2027.  Interest expense has been excluded from Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (11)Management has excluded the gain on the sale related to non-marketable equity investments in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring, and management believes that this income is not indicative of ongoing operating performance (12)The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is due to the net tax effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.  (13)Non-GAAP EPS as adjusted did not exclude the impact of foreign currency.  Had the impact of foreign currency been excluded for the three months ended December 26, 2020, September 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, non-GAAP EPS as adjusted would have been $0. 08, loss of less than one cent, and $0. 02, respectively, and for the twelve months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, non-GAAP EPS as adjusted would have been $(0. 19) and $(0. 57), respectively.  (14)The non-GAAP diluted shares include the potentially dilutive securities from Infinera's stock-based benefit plans excluded from the computation of dilutive net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  These potentially dilutive securities are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when Infinera has net income on a non-GAAP basis.  During the three months ended December 26, 2020, the Company included the dilutive effects of the 2027 Notes in the calculation of diluted net income per common share as the average market price was above the conversion price of the Notes.  The dilutive impact of the Notes was based on the difference between the Company's average stock price during the period and the conversion price of the Notes.

WFAM is the asset management unit of the bank, with $603 billion in assets under management and specialized investment teams with more than 450 investment professionals.  The deal is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021.  Per the terms of the transaction, Wells Fargo (WFC) will continue to serve as a client and distribution partner, holding a 9. 9% equity interest.  Wells Fargo’s Wealth & Investment Management division CEO Barry Sommers said, “Operating as an independent firm as a portfolio company of GTCR and Reverence Capital will provide numerous benefits to WFAM’s clients, employees, and strategic partners — including Wells Fargo. ” (See Wells Fargo stock analysis on TipRanks) “At the same time, this transaction reflects Wells Fargo’s strategy to focus on businesses that serve our core consumer and corporate clients, and will allow us to focus even more on growing our wealth and brokerage businesses,” he added.  On Feb. 18, J. P.  Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja upgraded the stock to Hold from Sell and increased the price target to $37 from $31. 50 following “news reports that the Federal Reserve accepted the company’s plan to overhaul its risk management and compliance, which is a critical step on the path to eventual lifting of the asset cap. ” Juneja believes the company’s “valuation is appropriate after factoring in potential earnings benefit from lifting of the asset cap plus sizable cost savings from its restructuring. ” However, the analyst said, “there is still much uncertainty about the full earnings run rate and profitability once the restructuring is completed. ” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating.  That’s based on 11 analysts suggesting a Buy and 8 analysts recommending a Hold.  The average analyst price target of $36. 63 implies 1% downside potential to current levels.

2021-02-23 21:55:09#tech#The development of Dying Light 2 has been 'total chaos,' according to report#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-development-of-dying-light-2-has-been-total-chaos-according-to-report/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qR99xjfDtqMDwMzzmUtXA5-1200-80.jpg#en#0.0#www.pcgamer.com#"Dying Light 2 has had its share of struggles since it was announced almost three years ago at E3 2018.  Developer Techland made some very big promises regarding the impact of individual player choice on gameplay and outcomes, which would demand multiple playthroughs for anyone who wanted to see more than half of the content it offered.  But a planned release for spring 2020 was missed, and a new release date hasn't been set.  The game also lost its lead writer, Pawel Selinger, who departed earlier this year after more than 20 years at the studio. A new report on Techland published by TheGamer suggests that the project may be floundering largely due to problems at the studio, particularly regarding the ""autocratic"" management style of CEO Pawel Marchewka.  Interviews with ten current and former employees allege problems including an over-reliance on external consultants who lack experience in the games industry (whose advice is often ignored anyway), conflict at the production level, a high rate of staff turnover, and micromanagement that some developers characterized as ""the eye of Sauron,"" which has collectively had the effect of stripping the game of a ""coherent vision. ""Techland has a history of hiring people for which the team had 'high hopes,' but it ended up in nothing,"" one source said.  ""One such case for the designers was the hiring of Marc Albinet, a former game director from Ubisoft, that was supposed to restructure how design is done in the studio.  Even he, a veteran with 30 years of experience, couldn't break through upper management that is harder to change than the spin of the fucking Earth. ""New hires and consultant who don't follow the company line end up sidelined, according to another source, which ultimately leads to their resignation or termination: ""To make a career at Techland, you have to be subservient. ""Techland's insistence on using its own internal technology to power the game is also a stumbling block, according to some employees.  Dying Light uses the Chrome Engine, a proprietary 3D engine developed by Techland, but after the first game was released the chief development officer at the time, Pawel Zawodny, wanted development of the sequel to be iterated in a more widely used engine, like Unreal or Unity, before bringing their work to the Chrome Engine.  Marchewka, however, insisted on everything being done in Chrome Engine 6. ""It slowed everyone down and that frustrated everyone,"" a source told TheGamer.  ""He would ask why people aren't working faster and it was because the tech isn’t up to speed.  We can work faster, but we have to go here, and you're not allowing us to go there.  The experts know what the goal is, and they should be allowed the flexibility to do what’s best. ""Zawodny, who now heads up CD Projekt Red's Wroclaw studio, brought on consultants of his own to help build a more conventional workflow, but many of their suggestions were apparently not adopted.  The system as it currently stands, one employee told TheGamer, is ""a production pipeline that changes so quickly and rapidly that it might as well not exist. "" More producers have been hired to help get the wheels turning, but reportedly often find their efforts blocked be veteran employees. The report touches on a range of other issues, such as producers interfering in design decisions—one source said producers on Dying Light 2 ""cannot hold the pipeline or milestones together, but they [have] time to redesign or argue about design""—and constant micromanagement from upper management, which collectively points to an atmosphere of chaos and aimlessness at the studio, and on Dying Light 2. ""What is going on in Techland is just total chaos, not iteration,"" a source said.  ""There are plenty of examples where there is someone responsible for a given feature—like a game director decides on something—but Pyza [creative director Adrian 'Pyza' Ciszewski] and Marchewka just overwrite this because of some bullshit reason, like they've seen something working differently in other games so we can do it like that. ""Marchewka defended the studio and its processes, saying that ""trust and the flow of ideas in a large organization is a complex issue. ""We are currently working on creating an innovative game that millions of players around the world will love, and thus we are constantly looking for methods that allow us to improve the transmission of fresh and interesting ideas,"" he said.  ""However, not every idea is a good idea for this project, and only the best and consistent ones with the vision of the project will be implemented in our game. ”Unfortunately, there's still no sign of a Dying Light 2 release date: Techland said in January when it confirmed Selinger's departure that it would ""be sharing exciting news about Dying Light 2 soon,"" but as of now there's been no sign of what that news might be.  I've reached out to Techland for comment, and will update if I receive a reply. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-development-of-dying-light-2-has-been-total-chaos-according-to-report/#BXodmttyB

It’s all pretty technical, but in the most basic of terms, it’s wear-and-tear on some of the components.  Another interesting thing to come out of the PS5 controller teardown: the company that supplies joysticks for the PS5 Dual Sense is the same company that supplies joysticks for the Nintendo Switch joycon controllers.  And as we all know, Nintendo is dealing with their own issues with joy-con drift.  But don’t go pointing fingers just yet, it might not be the joysticks themselves that are causing drift.  And in other news, EA is looking to patent a way for gamers to play their digital games via streaming immediately after purchase, instead of having to wait hours for the game to download.  Pretty cool.  Switching gears from games to entertainment, The CW’s Superman and Lois premieres tomorrow! We’ve got a short preview of what the super-couple have been up to since the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.  It’s your Daily Fix!

2021-02-22 20:13:23#tech#When Android 12 is coming to your phone#https://phandroid.com/2021/02/22/when-android-12-is-coming-to-your-phone/#https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android-12-pixel-5-8-640x427.jpg#en#0.0#phandroid.com#There are quite a lot of new features that are hidden away in Android 12, which is what we have come to expect.  Google has just released the first developer preview, and there are some changes enabled by default, and others that aren’t as obvious.  What’s new in Android 12 As is the case with every major version of Android, Pixel devices get the first crack at the latest features.  Then, phone makers will start to release beta versions of their own (in certain areas), before releasing the final updates.  But that still leads to the question of ‘When is my phone getting Android 12?’ Android 12 Release Schedule Last week marked the first release of the Android 12 developer preview, meaning that we are still a few months away from any official beta release.  According to the official release schedule that was provided, the first Android 12 beta could launch as early as May.  Expect to see the first Android 12 beta launch in May This would get Android 12 into the hands of more users, allowing for bugs to be fixed and features to either be added or removed.  There will be a total of four betas released ahead of the final version.  If Android 11 was any indication, then we could see the final version of Android 12 released in early September.  Google Pixel As is the case with every release of Android, Google Pixel owners will receive Android 12 the day that it’s released.  Barring any setbacks, we are expecting to see the first beta for Pixel owners arrive sometime in May.  Then, the final release is slated for sometime later this year, and according to the schedule provided by Google, Android 12 should arrive for everyone in September.  These are the Pixel devices we are expecting to see receive Android 12: Pixel 3 / 3XL Pixel 3a / 3a XL Pixel 4 / 4 XL Pixel 4a / 4a 5G Pixel 5 Android 12 marks the end of support for the good ole’ Pixel 2 and 2 XL, which was expected considering Google’s previous three-year commitment for device updates.  Samsung For years, Samsung was one of the most egregious offenders when it came to providing timely software updates.  However, over the last year or so, Samsung has changed its tune.  This was evidenced by the “mad dash” to push the Android 11 update (via One UI 3. 0), before updating many of its handsets to One UI 3. 5.  The company has even just announced that it will be providing up to four years of security updates for smartphones, starting with the Galaxy S10 line that was released in 2019.  As for Android 12, there’s no real way to tell when the update will officially arrive for your smartphone.  We do know that almost any phone released starting in 2019 will receive the update.  Alongside the launch of the Galaxy Note 20, Samsung confirmed that it will be sticking to three years of major Android releases for devices.  Based on the schedule for the Android 11 update, we can expect to see devices starting to receive the update at the end of 2021, and into the beginning of 2022.  These are the devices we are expecting to see receive Android 12: Galaxy S21 / S21+ / S21 Ultra Galaxy S20 / S20+ / S20 Ultra / S20 FE Galaxy Note 20 / Note 20 Ultra Galaxy S10 / S10e / S10 Lite / S10 Plus Galaxy Note 10 / Note 10+ / Note 10 Lite Galaxy Z Flip / Z Flip 5G Galaxy Z Fold 2 Galaxy A71 Galaxy A51 Galaxy A90 5G Galaxy Tab S7 / S7+ Galaxy Tab S6 / S6 Lite OnePlus Ignoring OnePlus’ budget lineup for a moment, the company has a pretty solid track record for releasing stable versions of new Android releases.  For example, Android 11 was released for Pixel owners on September 8th, and it arrived on the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro on October 10th.  Although older devices, like the OnePlus 7 and 7T have seen mixed results due to buggy beta versions, we can expect a quick turnaround from OnePlus for its newer handsets.  It’s also important to note that the Android 12 release could spell the end of official support for the OnePlus 6 and 6T.  These are the OnePlus devices we are expecting to see receive Android 12: OnePlus 7 / 7T / 7T Pro OnePlus 8 / 8 Pro / 8T OnePlus Nord Motorola A company that was once at the top of the list with software updates, has slowly turned into one of the more frustrating companies.  Motorola launched the new Moto One 5G Ace, G Stylus, and G Power earlier this year, but all three handsets shipped with Android 10.  In fact, when the company shared its plans for updating devices to Android 11, it stated that many of those devices would not receive the update to Android 12.  Motorola has yet to share a roadmap of when it expects to release the Android 12 update for recently-launched products.  However, it did confirm that both the Edge+ and Moto RAZR would be receiving the update.  So it’s just a waiting game until we find out a more concrete answer on the update schedule.  LG When 2021 is all said and done, we wouldn’t be surprised if LG makes its official exit out of the smartphone game.  It’s been rumored and suggested that this would be the plan at some point, even after showing off the LG Rollable at CES 2021.  Following that up, a recent report claims that LG has reached out to its manufacturing partners for the Rollable, requesting to pause production.  LG has fallen quite hard, as it was once a provider of a great smartphone experience.  But it seems that the battle to keep up with the Samsung’s and Apple’s of the world has taken its toll.  The company has not given any indication as to when and/or if its recently-released smartphones will get an update to Android 12.  In the event that LG sticks around, these are the devices would expect to see updated to Android 12: LG V60 ThinQ LG Wing LG Velvet Oppo When a new version of Android is introduced, company's begin their internal testing, similar to what we see Google do ahead of the final launch.  Oppo is one of those companies that has been not only performing internal testing, but also opens up a beta program for new versions of Color OS.  With Android 12, we're expecting to see a similar schedule to what we have seen with the Android 11 release cycle.  Development will begin around now, with a beta program to launch shortly after the final version of Android 12 is released.  This will be available for select devices (usually the higher-end models), before trickling down to more options from Oppo's lineup.  We wouldn't be surprised to see the first beta of Color OS (12?) released in September, ahead of the final version rolling out in October, November, and/or December of this year.  Xiaomi Xiaomi is still in the process of updating its vast array of devices to Android 11 (courtesy of MIUI 12), and there's a laundry list of smartphones left to go.  However, that doesn't necessarily mean that Android 12 will be avoided altogether, as we're sure the company is getting a head-start on the development process.  Whenever the next version of MIUI is announced, it will likely either be MIUI 12. 5 or MIUI 13, and will be based on Android 12.  The real question is when this will roll out to devices, but if we were guessing, Android 12 wouldn't be arriving until sometime in early 2022.  Vivo One company that has a lot of pull in other areas of the world, but doesn't have the greatest track record when it comes to updates is Vivo.  The company has shown that it's willing to push the envelope when it comes to hardware development, but the software side is another story.  Thankfully, it seems that Vivo is changing its tune a bit when it comes to its newer devices like the iQOO 3 5G.  Vivo has confirmed that the iQOO 3 will receive two major Android updates, including Android 12, along with security updates for a total of three years.  Huawei Thanks to the trade ban in the U. S. , Huawei's hand was forced when it came to developing its own software for its devices.  The company has pivoted to HarmonyOS, which has been in development for a few years now.  However, until the trade ban, there were no immediate plans to switch the operating systems from Google's Android.  With that being said, starting in April of this year, Huawei devices will be released with HarmonyOS in-tow.  This means that future smartphones will not be powered by Android 12, and unless something changes between Huawei and the U. S. , HarmonyOS will be the way of the future for Huawei. #https://phandroid.com/2021/02/22/when-android-12-is-coming-to-your-phone/#mnhpMnQMG

This could see the machines fail in less than two years, if the numbers are correct, and while this really is a worst-case scenario, it still paints a worrying picture about the longevity of the new machines.  Something compounded by the fact that the SSDs are soldered on the mainboards, which means replacing them isn't straightforward. Core to what's going on is the way in which SSDs work, specifically the number of writes they can reliably support.  The flash memory on the drives can only be written to a certain number of times before becoming unstable.  There are plenty of systems in place to spread the load across all the memory cells, but essentially there's a point where the drive has been written to so many times that it can no longer reliably hold the information. This is all summed up by the Total Bytes Written figure, measured in terabytes (which is why it's also referred to as Terabytes Written).  This needs to be considered in the context of the length of the warranty, which is generally five years. #https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-m1-macs-appear-to-be-chewing-through-their-ssds/#noV94HdfR

The auditing office said the cost of cancelling construction contracts and paying off bonds backing the project could reach $14. 5 billion, compared to López Obrador’s estimate of $4. 5 billion. #https://news.yahoo.com/mexican-president-defends-costly-pet-212344926.html#HJChH1kio

(“BigCommerce”) (Nasdaq: BIGC), a leading open SaaS ecommerce platform for fast-growing and established brands, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.  “2020 marked a historic year for BigCommerce with our fourth quarter revenue up 39% year-over-year and our ARR increasing 41% year-over-year to $181. 2 million,” said Brent Bellm, CEO at BigCommerce.  “We remain strategically focused on serving the needs of merchants of all sizes, and this past quarter further illustrates our ability to disrupt the mid-market and large enterprise market segments with 51% year over year growth in enterprise account ARR. ” Financial Highlights Total revenue was $43. 1 million, up 39% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Total annual revenue run-rate (ARR) as of December 31, 2020 was $181. 2 million, up 41% compared to December 31, 2019. ARR from accounts with at least one Enterprise plan (“Enterprise accounts”) was $100. 8 million as of December 31, 2020, up 51% compared to December 31, 2019.

Accounts greater than $2,000 in ACV as a percent of total ARR was 82%, up from 78% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Net revenue retention for accounts greater than $2,000 in ACV finished at 113% in 2020, up from 106% in 2019. New SMB, Mid-Market and Enterprise customers were added at an estimated LTV to CAC ratio of 4. 9:1, up from 4. 4:1 in 2019 Business Highlights Product Highlights: The Company continues to invest in building the best open SaaS ecommerce platform in the world, supported and integrated with the Company’s extensive network of best-of-breed technology and agency partners.  Fourth quarter highlights include:-- The Company further optimized the product for international markets by adding support for German, Dutch, Portuguese, and Swedish to its merchant admin panel and a native integration to global payments partner, Checkout. com. -- It bolstered its Open SaaS strategy by introducing Storefront API powered by GraphQL, which is optimized for headless implementations including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), native mobile experiences and Content Management Systems (CMSs). -- The Company completed the rollout of Channel Manager in October, a unified hub to help merchants streamline listing and selling products on third-party sales channels via seamless integrations with Amazon, eBay, Wish, Google, and Facebook/Instagram to help amplify merchant reach to millions of shoppers.  In parallel, the Company launched Channels Toolkit, -- a toolset composed of APIs, resources, and tools -- that enables partners and developers to deeply integrate third-party channels. Merchant Highlights: The Company added leading brands across multiple industries including HoMedics, a leader in home health wellness innovations; HMD Global, the official licensee of Nokia brand mobile phones and services; and Spiceology, one of the fastest-growing private spice companies in America. Partner Highlights: Our ecosystem grew to include integration with PayPal’s newly acquired EMEA point-of-sale platform, iZettle; leading ads provider Teikametrics; and subscription billing solutions Sticky. io and Recharge.  As previously announced, BigCommerce partnered with Wish to expand our merchants’ sales channels to include one of the largest global Marketplaces. Team/Culture: BigCommerce was proud to be recognized as a Top WorkPlace by the Austin American-Statesman for the 9th year in a row, in addition to numerous other awards received in 2020, such as Great Place to Work Australia and San Francisco Bay Area’s Best and Brightest Companies.  Fourth Quarter Financials: Other Key Business Metrics Number of accounts greater than $2,000 in annual contract value (ACV) was 10,184, up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Average revenue per account (ARPA) of accounts greater than $2,000 in ACV was $14,615, up 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.  Operating Income/(Loss) GAAP operating loss was ($13. 8) million, compared to ($9. 8) million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP operating loss was ($7. 6) million, compared to ($8. 8) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Net Income/(Loss) and Earnings Per Share GAAP net loss was ($14. 2) million, compared to ($10. 3) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Non-GAAP net loss was ($8. 0) million or (18%) of total revenue, compared to ($9. 4) million or (30%) of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The nearly 12 point improvement in non-GAAP net loss as a percent of revenue was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving further leverage in the business as the Company continues to scale. GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 21) based on 68. 6 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($0. 68) based on 18. 0 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 12) based on 68. 6 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($0. 52) based on 18. 0 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was negative ($6. 8) million, compared to ($8. 1) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively and drive operating leverage in R&D and sales and marketing spending.  Fiscal Year 2020 Financials: Total revenue was $152. 4 million, up 36% compared to fiscal year 2019.  Operating Income/(Loss) GAAP operating loss was ($38. 7) million, compared to ($41. 0) million in fiscal year 2019. Non-GAAP operating loss was ($27. 4) million, compared to ($37. 8) million in fiscal year 2019.  Net Income/(Loss) and Earnings Per Share GAAP net loss was ($37. 6) million, compared to ($42. 6) million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss was ($30. 7) million or (20%) of total revenue, compared to ($39. 4) million or (35%) of total revenue in fiscal year 2019.  The nearly 15 point improvement in non-GAAP net loss as a percent of revenue was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving further leverage in the business as the Company continues to scale. GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 99) based on 39. 1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($2. 80) based on 17. 8 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal year 2019. Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 79) based on 39. 1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($2. 21) based on 17. 8 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal year 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was ($24. 5) million, compared to ($35. 5) million in fiscal year 2019.  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving operating leverage in R&D and sales and marketing spending.  This increase was partially offset by higher costs in G&A primarily due to public company expenses.  Cash Cash and cash equivalents totaled $219. 4 million as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was ($26. 5) million, compared to ($40. 0) million for the same period in 2019. Free cash flow was ($28. 5) million, compared to ($45. 5) million for the same period in 2019.  Q1 and 2021 Financial OutlookFor the first quarter of 2021, the Company currently expects: Total revenue between $41. 8 million and $42. 3 million. Non-GAAP operating loss between ($8. 2) million and ($7. 9) million.  For the full year 2021, the Company currently expects: Total revenue between $189. 0 million and $191. 0 million. Non-GAAP operating loss between ($34. 5) million and ($33. 3) million.  The Company’s first quarter and 2021 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the Company’s control.  If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change.  There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.  The Company does not provide guidance for operating loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating loss, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share and these comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items.  These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.

However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.  These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q1 and 2021 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies.  By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.  These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others, our business would be harmed by any decline in new customers, renewals or upgrades, our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future results of operations, we operate in competitive markets, we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future, our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform or certain social media platforms, and a cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks could negatively affect our business.  Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our final prospectus under Rule 424(b) filed with the SEC, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC and the future quarterly and current reports that we file with the SEC.

BigCommerce assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.  Annual revenue run-rate We calculate annual revenue run-rate (“ARR”) at the end of each month as the sum of: (1) the product of the current month’s monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) multiplied by twelve (to prospectively annualize subscription revenue), and (2) the trailing twelve-month partner and services revenue, including non-recurring services revenue, such as one-time partner integration fees and store-launch services.  MRR includes BigCommerce platform subscription fees and invoiced growth adjustments as customers’ businesses grow past contracted order thresholds after a threshold has been met.  It also includes recurring professional services revenue, such as recurring technical account management services and product training services.  Accounts with greater than $2,000 ACV We track the total number of accounts with annual contract value (“ACV”) greater than $2,000 (the “ACV threshold”) as of the end of a monthly billing period.  To define this $2,000 ACV cohort, we include only subscription plan revenue and exclude partner and services revenue and recurring services revenue.  We consider all stores added and subtracted as of the end of the monthly billing period.  This metric includes accounts that may have either one single store above the ACV threshold or multiple stores that together exceed the ACV threshold.  Accordingly, this cohort would include: (1) customers on Enterprise plans, (2) customers on Pro plans, and (3) customers with multiple plans that together exceed the ACV threshold.  Average revenue per account We calculate average revenue per account (ARPA) for accounts above the ACV threshold at the end of a period by including customer-billed revenue and an allocation of partner and services revenue.  Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, changes in fair value of financial instruments, and our provision for income taxes.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.  Non-GAAP Operating Loss We define Non-GAAP Operating Loss as our GAAP Loss from operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our loss from operations.  Non-GAAP Net Loss We define Non-GAAP Net Loss as our GAAP net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our net loss.  Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share We define Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share as our Non-GAAP Net Loss, defined above, divided by our basic and diluted GAAP weighted average shares outstanding.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our net loss per share.

This week we posed the following question to 1,000 Benzinga readers on the 2021 price action of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE).  Over the next year, which cryptocurrency will have the largest percentage gain? Bitcoin 37% Ethereum 32% Dogecoin 31% As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been hitting new highs in recent months.  Bitcoin trades around $53,000 at time of publication, off the all-time high of $58,300.  See Also: Is Bitcoin A Good Investment? Experts in crypto like Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, believe the price of Bitcoin is going to reach 0,000 by the end of the year.  Ethereum expands upon Bitcoin’s infrastructure in terms of useability.  Instead of only transferring coins between wallets, Ethereum’s network supports the creation of decentralized applications, or DApps, that allow users to execute agreements with one another without the use of a middleman.  Ethereum trades around $1,750 at publication time, off the all-time high of $2,036.  Meanwhile, Dogecoin is built on the same basic technology as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  The Shiba-Inu based cryptocurrency was introduced as a joke in 2013 to help raise public awareness of the capabilities of blockchain technology.  Now, Dogecoin is catching on with celebrities from Elon Musk to Gene Simmons.  Dogecoin trades around 5 cents and has an all-time high of $0. 087.

Today it dropped a trailer showcasing the new mode in action, along with a blog post detailing how it's all going to work. The trailer isn't much to write home about, I don't think: Gunfire, explosions, zombies, and generic one-liners delivered flatly by voice actors who sound like they're reading from the phone book, while a classic rock remix plays in the background.  The blog post is a different story, however.  There's plenty of narrative background if you're into that sort of thing, and more practically there's also a breakdown of how the new mode will actually play. Squads of up to four players will be inserted into the Outbreak zone and given one of five objectives to investigate and complete.  How you approach these objectives is entirely up to you: You can take any route to get there, and as much time as you like along the way.  Exploring the region will uncover rewards in loot chests, trigger random encounters, and open up Trial Computers. More types of missions are expected to be added as Outbreak grows and evolves, but for now, this is what you'll be getting up to:"#https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-details-how-call-of-duty-cold-wars-zombies-outbreak-mode-will-actually-work/#ewwo6OIuk
