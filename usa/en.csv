The decaying hulks scar the northern part of the Palestinian enclave, but this bleak scene is about to change.  For years Palestinian vehicles and drivers have been blocked by Israeli walls and checkpoints.  Now, a shift in Israeli policy means that thousands of the old cars and other pieces of scrap metal are finally leaving Gaza.  And local merchants, like Ahmed Moussa are cashing in.  ""There is a huge amount here.  We have been collecting material for the past 15 years, all of this was not exported for around 15 years.  Here I have, for an example, 20,000 tons.  Some people such as merchants have 20, others have 10.  Some people have been gathering metal for 15 years.  In Gaza, around 200,000 tons are piled up in Gaza. "" Everything from used truck parts to empty soda cans have accumulated along Gaza's frontier since the imposition of an Israeli-led blockade in 2007.  In October Israeli authorities cleared the metal for export to crushing plants inside Israel, creating a welcome source of revenue in the impoverished strip.  Israel is allowing 1,000 tons to be exported per week, at this pace the backlog would be cleared in four years.  Many Gazans would prefer to crush and recycle the metal for use inside the enclave, and build their own factories to recycle.  That wish is blocked by Israel and Egypt.  They restrict the entry of machinery into the Gaza Strip, citing the security threat posed by its Islamist rulers, Hamas.  Among the equipment prohibited is anything that could be used by militant groups to manufacture weapons - including new metal pressing machines.  But the work is still welcome news in Gaza where unemployment is 49%.  Merchants say the exports have secured jobs for around 6,000 Palestinian laborers.

Why it matters: The prisoner stipends — termed ""pay for slay"" by the Trump administration — are a primary concern for the Biden administration as it prepares to re-engage with the Palestinians. Support safe, smart, sane journalism.  Sign up for Axios Newsletters here.  * U. S.  and Palestinian officials acknowledge that a solution on the payments issue must be found as the U. S.  takes steps like renewing aid and reopening the PLO office in Washington.  They're therefore considering combining the issues into one package. Driving the news: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas tasked Shtayyeh with finding such a solution.  Shtayyeh has assembled a team of lawyers and experts, and he discussed the issue earlier this week during a call with Hady Amr, the U. S.  assistant secretary of state for Israel-Palestine.  * One possibility would be changing the law such that the payment criteria is based on the welfare needs of the prisoner and not on the crime committed. What they are saying: “We know we have to find a solution for the prisoner payments, but it is an important issue for many Palestinians and any solution must be dignified,"" a Palestinian official told me.  * The Palestinian official added that Shtayyeh told Amr in their phone call that U. S.  relations with the Palestinians should be bilateral — separate from the state of relations between the Palestinians and Israel. What to watch: One incentive the Biden administration could offer the Palestinians to make concessions on the payments would be the signing of a long-sought presidential waiver canceling the designation of the PLO as a terror organization. What’s next: State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday that the administration wants to renew humanitarian aid to the Palestinians quickly because Trump's suspension of aid ""didn't achieve political progress or compromises from the Palestinian leadership and only hurt the Palestinian people.

A U. S.  aid package for airline workers expires on April 1, and American Airlines (AAL) finds itself “in a situation similar to much of 2020,” said CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom in a memo to employees, which was also included in a regulatory filing.  “The vaccine is not being distributed as quickly as any of us believed, and new restrictions on international travel that require customers to have a negative COVID-19 test have dampened demand,” Parker and Isom added.  Reuters reports that American Airlines will offer their employees, including 1,850 pilots and 4,245 flight attendants, voluntary exit packages in the hope that it will ease the possibility of involuntary retrenchments.  American Airlines reported its financial results for 2020 last week, posting a full-year net loss of around $9 billion.  In an attempt to boost liquidity, the airline company took advantage of the sharp rise in its share price due to the WallStreetBets inspired short squeeze and launched a $1 billion stock sale.  (See American Airlines stock analysis on TipRanks) Seaport Global analyst Daniel Mckenzie downgraded American Airlines three days ago from Buy to Hold and withdrew his price target.  “Our conviction in the recovery story doesn’t change, but given limited upside to our $19 target price, risk reward is balanced given COVID variants that slow the int’l revenue recovery and cause us to trim our pre-tax earnings outlook.  Hence our move to the sidelines today; downgrading to Neutral (from Buy) and withdrawing our target price,” Mckenzie explained.  Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Sell based on 1 Buy, 5 Holds and 7 Sells.  The average analyst price target of $14. 14 suggests downside potential of 20% over the next 12 months.  Hedge Fund Activity for AAL decreased substantially over the last quarter, with a significant reduction in holdings and a Very Negative Confidence Signal.

The Tool and Puscifer singer told Apple Music Hits’ George Stroumboulopoulos that he ended up in hospital in December 2020 after his second bout of the virus. “I don’t know if I said anything online, but I had it twice,” said Keenan of his experience.  “Ugly, ugly.  Couldn’t breathe.  I could barely put two words together without going into a coughing fit that, you know? It ended up kind of also progressing into pneumonia.  So, if I stayed in the hospital, they said, ‘Okay, we can keep you here, but you’re fighting 12 other people for a bed and a ventilator we don’t have, so what do you want to do?’ I’m like, ‘Well, I need to breathe and I need to sleep. ’”Keenan told Stroumboulopoulos that he decided to treat his symptoms at home. “There’s nothing you can do other than treat the symptom, so for a real cough medicine, not the crap over-the-counter and then like an inhaler, and some antibiotics to fight the pneumonia and strap the fuck in. ”Keenan has previously said that he initially contracted Covid in early 2020.  In October, he revealed that he was still dealing with the effects of the virus. “I survived it, but it wasn’t pretty,” he told AZ Central.  “I had to go through some major medications to undo the residual effects.  Still coughing.  There’s still lung damage. ”In another interview with The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Keenan poured scorn on Covid deniers and conspiracy theorists. “Maybe I didn’t almost die, but I have friends who almost died.  It was ugly.  And then you have people going… apparently I’m being paid to say this.  Eat a dick, dude. ”#https://www.loudersound.com/news/tools-maynard-james-keenan-ive-had-covid-twice#s8MJsd8Ez

Ark ETFs include the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK), Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE: ARKW), Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS: ARKG), Ark Fintech Innotvation ETF (NYSE: ARKF) and Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS: ARKQ).  The themes presented by Cathie Wood and her team could provide hints at which companies in the future could be included in the ETFs.  Here is a look at some potential candidates based on the Ark Funds 2021 Big Ideas.  1.  Desktop Metal: 3D printing company Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM) fits the profile of the 3D printing theme revolutionizing manufacturing.  Desktop Metal is included in the 3D Printing ETF (BATS: PRNT) and based on the comments from Ark could soon be added to additional ETFs from the company.  Chamath Palihapitiya is an investor in the company.  The so-called SPAC King calls Desktop Metal a leader in the new era of printing and said it can work with automotive and aerospace companies to create parts with less weight.  This production scale is considered the holy grail.  Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is another investor in the company.  2.  AST & Science: Going public via a SPAC deal with New Providence Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: NPA), AST & Science is bringing its ambitious plans for 5G from space to the public markets.  The company seems like a perfect fit for Ark’s Big Idea of orbital aerospace.  Under this idea, Ark calls for satellite broadband to see strong revenue growth in the future.  AST is targeting the $1 trillion global mobile wireless service market.  AST said that 51% of the global population does not have mobile broadband.  The company’s plans call for launching over 180 satellites to bring 5G access to customers with a goal of hitting 373 million subscribers by 2027.  Related Link: Cathie Wood Increases Teladoc Holdings Across Ark ETFs 3.  Virgin Galactic: News that Ark Funds was launching a Space ETF sent names of space related companies like Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE: SPCE) higher.  Virgin Galactic seems could be the perfect fit for the Ark Big Idea of orbital aerospace, which includes hypersonic flight.  4.  SoFi: Wood has added several SPACs to the Ark ETFs and the next one added could be Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings VCorp (NYSE: IPOE).  The Palihapitiya-backed SPAC is taking SoFi public.  The Big Ideas presentation calls for digital wallets to be a $4. 6 trillion opportunity.  SoFi is singled out as an example in the North American region.  5.  Brooks Automation: One Big Idea theme is automation, a sector that Brooks Automation (NASDAQ: BRKS) fits into.  Brooks Automation powers the semiconductor and life sciences sectors with robots and automations.  With the focus on automation and robotics across several Ark funds, this could be a stock worth watching for investors.  6.  EHang Holdings: Autonomous aerial vehicle company EHang Holdings (NASDAQ: EH) is up over 450% in the last year.  The company has become one of the ways for investors to get exposure to the growing passenger transport and logistics for urban air mobility.  With the focus on drone delivery as a 2021 Big Idea, Ehang could be on the radar of Ark Funds.  7.  Natera: Natera Inc (NASDAQ: NTRA) is the global leader in cell-free DNA testing focusing on women’s health and oncology.  The company could find itself fitting into the Ark Funds Big Idea of long road sequencing.

2021-02-03 05:50:36#business#Musk Keeps Sparring With Regulators as Biden Builds Cabinet#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-keeps-sparring-regulators-biden-001053337.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UsFTtHmWJ7d0xt4ImjGZ9g--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/1831d57f0d1ea066f0896702d1ba614c#en#0.0#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk has a long history of run-ins with the local, state and federal officials who oversee his growing empires at Tesla Inc.  and SpaceX.  The world’s richest person shows no signs of changing his ways as U. S.  President Joe Biden takes office and bolsters the regulatory agencies defanged by his predecessor. In the past week alone, Musk has tangled with the Federal Aviation Administration over a December rocket test flight that ended in flames and begrudgingly agreed to recall some Tesla cars at highway-safety officials’ urging.  And while he announced Tuesday he was taking a break from Twitter -- the platform that previously got him fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- Musk had already used his favorite social-media megaphone in the preceding days to roil stocks of companies from Etsy Inc.  to Shopify Inc.  during a retail-trading frenzy. The potential for more conflict is building as Biden works to confirm his cabinet secretaries and reinvigorate agencies following the Donald Trump era.  Democratic administrations have historically been tougher on industry regulation, and Musk’s empire intersects with government oversight of automobiles, spaceflight, energy, telecommunications and medical equipment. In a series of comments on Tuesday, the FAA said that Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  had ignored the agency back on Dec.  9 to go ahead with a test launch of its massive Starship rocket -- a test that ended in a blazing fireball when the prototype malfunctioned on landing.  The FAA said it had turned down SpaceX ’s request to exceed the maximum public risk for that launch, and after the explosion had suspended testing at the site until a company-led investigation was complete and its regulators approved SpaceX’s corrective actions. The FAA’s comments added some clarity to the dispute that led to an angry tweet from Musk on Jan.  28 in which he accused the agency of having a “fundamentally broken regulatory structure. ” His ire against the FAA was triggered after another SpaceX test flight was delayed. Without giving much detail, the FAA in a Tuesday morning email said that SpaceX was now in compliance and could proceed with another test.  Within hours, the unmanned Starship SN-9 lifted off from SpaceX’s seaside launch pad at 2:25 p. m.  Tuesday in Boca Chica, Texas, flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (6. 2 miles) -- and exploded as it attempted to land, like the earlier rocket. Later in the day, the agency said it will lead the investigation into the latest “landing mishap” and look for other ways to enhance safety. Meanwhile, Tesla has been engaged in a long back and forth with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the failure of touch screens in some of its Model S and Model X vehicles.  Last month, NHTSA sent a letter to Tesla saying it had determined the failures constituted a defect.  Tesla responded that it “respectfully disagrees” with the finding but will voluntarily initiate a recall.  Impacted Tesla customers received emails that said they will be notified “when the parts become available. ”“Tesla makes it very clear that they don’t think this is necessary, but they are doing this to make the issue go away,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business, in a phone interview Tuesday.  “If NHTSA had not written the recall request letter, Tesla would not have done this. ”Musk, 49, is widely heralded for disrupting the auto industry with high performance electric cars and upending Big Aerospace with reusable rockets. His companies are growing: Tesla is building two new factories in Berlin and in Austin, Texas, while SpaceX -- which has contracts with the Air Force and NASA -- is rolling out Starlink, its high speed Internet service, to rural and remote customers across the U. S. , Canada and the U. K.  There’s also the Boring Co. , his tunnel-construction business, and Neuralink, which is testing its brain machine interface device on monkeys and pigs and hopes to begin human trials this year. Musk’s frustration with regulators is legendary. He once hung up during a testy call with the head of the National Transportation Safety Board over Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system; the NTSB was irked in part by the company’s public comments about a crash probe.  Tesla has aggressively pushed out Autopilot -- including what it calls a Full Self-Driving upgrade -- much to the consternation of some safety advocates, even as driverless tech rivals like Google parent Alphabet Inc. ’s Waymo unit in recent weeks have taken pains to be more transparent and circumspect with their claims. When public health officials in California’s Alameda County ordered Tesla to close its factory last spring, Musk railed against the shut down orders as “fascist” on the company’s earnings call.  And despite settling with the SEC over his failed go-private bid in 2018, Musk has continued to taunt the agency, referring to them as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission. ”The settlement stripped Musk of the chairmanship of Tesla’s board for three years, meaning he could potentially resume the role this fall -- just as the Biden administration is re-establishing the government’s role in oversight.

2021-02-03 11:43:39#tech#AMD's supply issue is harming its best chance of gaining market share#https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2020/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mnzNfoMcmVXme8vxENcyjm-1200-80.jpg#en#0.765#www.pcgamer.com#After the past couple of years, it may be tough to believe what I'm about to say, but here we go: Intel is currently beating AMD in CPU pricing and availability.  The result of which, according to a report from Mercury Research, is that AMD is actually losing market share for the first time since 2017. Off the back of its technical expertise with the Zen CPU architecture, AMD has been snapping up market share these past few years.  Most recently, and according to Mercury Research (via Tom's Hardware), its desktop offerings accounted for 20. 1 percent of the market.  A significant increase from 9. 9 percent back in 2016. There have been similar gains for AMD in mobile processors and, to a lesser extent, in servers too.  The latter is to be expected, however, as switching servers progresses much slower than with us fickle gaming lot on desktop. The latest numbers show that AMD's momentum has slowed a little over the course of the final three months of 2020.  Its desktop processor share shrunk by 0. 8 percent and its mobile share by 1. 2 percent compared to the previous quarter. We can speculate on reasons why, but as Tom's Hardware rightly points out, it's not for a lack of x86 processor sales.  In fact, business is booming, and AMD should be crushing it with its most impressive CPU architecture to date. Mercury Research reports that the x86 market processor grew at 20. 1 percent for the quarter.  Paired with AMD's strong growth from recent earnings reports, it's understandably not as much a question of demand as it is of supply. #https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2020/#aZ2sUDCAi

Activision has been trying to combat the problem since last year by banning tens of thousands of cheating players en masse — in fact, the video game giant has just banned 60,000 accounts for confirmed cases of using cheat software in Warzone.  While Activision didn’t say what cheat software the banned players used, the sources that talked to Vice said this wave targeted EngineOwning customers. #https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-warzone-bans-60000-confirmed-cheaters-071107304.html#3JgYZmuR2

During EA's earning's call today, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that more information about the ""next Battlefield experience,"" which is due sometime this holiday season, would be revealed ""in the months ahead. ""It's not much to go on, but it's the first news we've had regarding Battlefield since November, when Wilson said it would feature ""never-before-seen scale. "" He reiterated that promise today, saying that the game ""takes full advantage of the power of next generation platforms to bring massive, and immersive battles to life with more players than ever before. ""Featuring maps with unprecedented scale, the next Battlefield takes all the destruction, player agency, vehicle and weapon combat that the franchise is known for, and elevates it to the next level,"" Wilson added. When pressed for more details later in the call, Wilson said:  ""We don't have anything more to share with you at this point other than we believe it's going to usher in a new generation for Battlefield games and Battlefield fans, and we'll be benefitting from the full power of next-gen platforms.  You should imagine we're looking across all forms of the experience to ensure it's exactly the game that Battlefield fans want to play.
