Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, a move praised by Israel which has objected to the accord. #https://news.yahoo.com/israel-bahrain-leaders-discuss-netanyahu-095923787.html#wChYibDLo

S.  housing rally. The company posted adjusted revenue that beat estimates.  And with a ten-fold increase in net income last year to $9. 4 billion, Rocket declared a special dividend of $1. 11 per share, according to a statement on Thursday.  Shares surged as much as 7. 8% to $21. 46 in late trading. “We successfully drove growth in every segment of our business,” Rocket Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner said in the statement. The pandemic real estate boom gave a major boost to the mortgage industry, which posted record loan volume and profits in 2020 as rates dipped to historic lows.  Much of that was thanks to the Federal Reserve, which kept a lid on borrowing costs and bought mortgage bonds as part of its bid to stimulate the economy. But profitability may have peaked.  Rocket reported a 4. 41% profit margin on newly originated loans last quarter, well above the company’s November estimate of 3. 8% to 4. 1%.  It told investors on Thursday to expect margins on new loans this quarter to be around 3. 6% to 3. 9%. Mortgage lenders have been warning investors in recent weeks that profitability won’t expand this year.  UWM Holdings Corp. , the parent company of United Wholesale Mortgage, said profits on new loans this quarter could fall by as much as one-third from last year’s fourth quarter. Mr.  Cooper Group Inc. , meanwhile, said this week that its gains on mortgage sales -- lenders generally sell the loans they originate -- will be roughly flat this quarter. Read more: In a Flash, U. S.  Yields Hit 1. 6%, Wreaking Havoc Across MarketsMortgage rates in the U. S.  rose this week to the highest level in six months, threatening to snuff out the mortgage rally.  And with Treasury yields ticking higher, borrowing costs could continue to climb. That could deter more Americans from seeking to refinance debt, while surging home prices are pushing ownership out of reach for many. Mortgage applications fell to a nine-month low last week, while pending home sales last month dropped to a six-month low.

2021-02-26 03:49:06#business#Central Banks Fight Back Against Bond Rout, Calming Investors#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-rout-extends-asia-222746094.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uVMS0Rbq05n7XYmwFwQ0Lw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/d78742ab2ab8ffae961200023b787435#en#0.0258#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- The standoff between central banks and bond traders took center stage in Asia on Friday after Treasury yields surged to a one-year high, forcing policymakers into a slew of debt purchases to calm panicking markets. The Reserve Bank of Australia waded in with more than $2 billion of unscheduled purchases, while Korea announced buying plans for the next few months.  Traders are waiting to see if Japan will act to stop its benchmark yield from breaking out of its target range. The deepening divide between traders and central banks over the pace of the economic recovery looks set to lead to days of showdown, where policymakers seek to retain control over borrowing costs.  The rapid repricing of the reflation trade is rippling through all markets, putting pressure on valuations and hurting government debt auctions. “Reflation now needs a rein, and central banks are fighting the sharp rise in yields,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd.  in Singapore.  “Their credibility is at stake here too -- if they want to maintain accommodative policy they have to act if markets look like they’re running away. ”Read More: In a Flash, U. S.  Yields Hit 1. 6%, Wreaking Havoc Across MarketsThe RBA is taking the lead this time in acting as a breakwater for rising yields, a role typically played by the Bank of Japan in Asia.  Its offer to buy A$3 billion ($2. 4 billion) of debt acted to cap the selloff, with Australia’s three-year bond yield erasing gains.  Treasury yields also came down from the 1. 6% highs reached Thursday night as Asian investors piled in. While the BOJ hasn’t acted yet, Finance Minister Taro Aso fired a warning shot as the benchmark yield surged to within a couple of basis points of the perceived tolerance limit of the central bank.  “It’s important that yields don’t suddenly jump up and down,” said Aso in Tokyo.  “We need to make sure not to lose the market’s trust with fiscal management. ”Read: BOJ’s Tolerance for Rising Yields Tested Before Policy ReviewThe carnage for emerging-markets though continues unabated. Yields on Indonesian bonds -- a bellwether for EM sentiment -- surged to levels last seen in October while Bank Indonesia said it will be in the market to guard against a currency sinking fast.  The Bank of Korea, which has been restrained in debt purchases, said it will spend up to 7 trillion won ($6. 2 billion) to buy bonds in the first half, signaling that it sees a prolonged battle. While markets are increasingly pricing in higher inflation and the potential for rate hikes, every major central bank from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank to the RBA see a prolonged period of easing as economies gradually recover. There are expectations that global central banks will try to contain a further rise in yields, said Kei Yamazaki, a senior fund manager in Tokyo at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.  “Fed officials have been tolerating the recent rise in yields, but the current risk-averse market will also prompt them to calm the market verbally. ”Read: Convexity Hedging Haunts Markets Already Reeling From Bond RoutBond market snapshot:Treasury 10-year yields down six basis points to 1. 46%Australia’s 3-year yield fell one basis point to 0. 12%10-year JGB surged to 0. 175%, a level last seen before the BOJ announced negative interest rates in January 2016Indonesia’s benchmark yields are up 12 basis points to 6. 68%Spreads on high-grade dollar notes from Asian issuers widened about 3 basis points, the most since April last year. Stocks in Asia witnessed a broad selloff.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped as much as 2. 5%, the most since June, with technology shares being the worst performers.  Equity benchmarks in South Korea, China, Taiwan and Japan plunged more than 2% each. The over-riding question for many investors is the extent of the selloff -- many on Wall Street didn’t foresee Treasury yields crossing 1. 5% so quickly -- as each bout triggers stop-losses and lures short-sellers.

S.  seeing record low demand at its Thursday debt auction.  Indonesia has already said it could pare back sales. “At a minimum, this pace of YCC needs to continue next week and I think the market’s looking for even more,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.  “They want to see that the RBA’s prepared to defend its target and to ensure financial conditions don’t tighten. ”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

(NASDAQ: BYND) (“Beyond Meat” or “the Company”), a leader in plant-based meat, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2020.  Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Highlights1 Net revenues were $101. 9 million, an increase of 3. 5% year-over-year.

Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, ""I am proud of our 2020 achievements in light of the significant challenges we faced, primarily in our foodservice channel, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the full year, we grew total net revenues 37%, with sales to retail customers more than doubling versus the prior year. "" Brown added, ""Although weakened foodservice demand resulting from the global pandemic has impacted our near-term profitability, we continue to press forward with strategic investments in service of our future growth, including the build out of our production facilities in China and Europe, bolstering our research and development capabilities, amplifying our marketing voice, upgrading our IT infrastructure, and, importantly, continuing to build out talented teams across the globe to bring our ambitious goals to fruition.  Given our view that we are at a pivotal juncture, where we have an opportunity to transition from niche market to mainstream stature with bold, strategic actions, we will continue to invest aggressively in 2021 to accelerate our path towards this objective.  I truly believe that plant-based meat has reached a tipping point in terms of its cultural relevance and, critically, the fundamentals underpinning Beyond Meat's long-term prospects remain robust, with important brand metrics such as household penetration, buyer rates, purchase frequency and repeat rates all registering another quarter of uninterrupted growth.  My optimism about Beyond Meat's future therefore remains as solid as ever.  As we stay true to our guiding principle of providing consumers with great-tasting plant-based meats, made without the use of GMOs, bioengineered ingredients, hormones, antibiotics or cholesterol, we believe we are on a path to building an enduring global protein company that advances a more sustainable meat supply chain, consumer health and the health of our planet. "" Fourth Quarter 2020 Net revenues increased 3. 5% to $101. 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $98. 5 million in the prior year period.  Growth in net revenues was primarily due to increased retail channel sales, largely offset by a decline in foodservice channel sales due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on foodservice demand levels.  Growth in volume sold during the fourth quarter of 2020 was partially offset by lower net price per pound driven by the Company’s strategic investments in promotional activity, and product mix shifts as larger-pack items carrying a lower net price per unit volume accounted for a greater proportion of the Company's retail net revenues compared to the prior year period.

Specifically, recent curtailments of production volumes, mainly in the third quarter of 2020, resulted in the capitalization of higher fixed cost inventory in the third quarter, which was subsequently recognized as higher per unit cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the Company sold off inventory on hand.  In addition, to a lesser extent, Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin also decreased due to lower net price realization resulting from higher trade discounts as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and product mix shifts.  The $3. 7 million in expenses attributable to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of 2020 were driven by incremental inventory write-offs and reserves associated with foodservice products determined to be unsalable.  Loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $24. 5 million compared to loss from operations of $0. 9 million in the prior year period.  The increase in loss from operations was primarily driven by the decline in gross profit, combined with higher operating expenses primarily due to the Company’s increased headcount to support long-term growth, investment in international expansion efforts, specifically in Europe and China, higher production trial costs, investments in IT infrastructure, and continued investments in marketing and research and development.  Net loss was $25. 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net loss of $0. 5 million in the prior year period.  Net loss per common share was $0. 40 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net loss per common share of $0. 01 in the prior year period.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, net loss included $3. 7 million in expenses attributable to COVID-19, specifically related to inventory write-offs and reserves of certain foodservice products.  Excluding these costs, Adjusted net loss was $21. 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, or $0. 34 per common share, compared to Adjusted net loss of $0. 5 million, or $0. 01 per common share, in the prior year period.  Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $9. 5 million, or -9. 3% of net revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $9. 5 million, or 9. 7% of net revenues, in the prior year period.  Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson commented, “We emerged from a challenging year on firm footing and stand ready to capitalize on several opportunities ahead of us.  We believe our resolve to proceed with significant investments in our key strategic initiatives reinforces our long-term position, putting in place the necessary capabilities and infrastructure to support the long-term growth potential underpinned by our strengthening business fundamentals. ” Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $159. 1 million as of December 31, 2020 and total outstanding debt was $25. 0 million.  Net cash used in operating activities was $40. 0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $47. 0 million for the prior year.  Capital expenditures totaled $57. 7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $23. 8 million for the prior year.  The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by the Company’s continued investments in production equipment and facilities related to capacity expansion initiatives.  Separately, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in investing activities also included $15. 5 million of payments for asset acquisitions, specifically related to the Company's purchase of a former co-manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania.  Update on COVID-19 and 2021 Outlook Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to experience significantly reduced demand in its foodservice channel as decreased foot traffic, streamlined menu offerings and restrictions on foodservice locations’ operating capacity have resulted in closures or meaningfully curtailed operations of many of its foodservice customers.  At the same time, the surge in demand from retail customers that characterized the early stages of the pandemic as consumers abruptly shifted towards more at-home consumption has moderated.  Given that the ongoing evolution of consumer demand patterns across retail and foodservice channels has significantly increased the difficulty in forecasting the Company's customer demand levels, management will not be providing 2021 guidance until further notice.  Conference Call and Webcast The Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss these results with additional comments and details today at 5:00 p. m.  Eastern, 2:00 p. m.  Pacific.  Investors interested in participating in the live call can dial 270-215-9602.  The conference call webcast will be available live over the Internet through the “Investors” section of the Company’s website at www. beyondmeat. com and later archived.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful additional information to investors about current trends in the Company's operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of operations.  In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance and for business planning purposes.  Management also believes these measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of our operational performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.  Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin Adjusted gross profit is defined as net revenues less cost of goods sold adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to COVID-19 which are not considered to be part of the Company’s normal business activities.  Adjusted gross margin is defined as Adjusted gross profit divided by net revenues.  Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin are presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in the Company’s gross profit and gross margin, which we believe is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare the Company’s current business performance from one period to another.  Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share Adjusted net (loss) income is defined as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to COVID-19, as well as other special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company’s ongoing normal business activities.  Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share is defined as Adjusted net (loss) income divided by the number of diluted common shares outstanding.  We consider Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share to be indicators of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations.  Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring expenses, share-based compensation expense, expenses attributable to COVID-19, remeasurement of our warrant liability, and Other, net, including investment income, loss on extinguishment of debt and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.  Limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues rather than their most directly comparable GAAP measures.  Some of these limitations are: Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin exclude costs associated with activities deemed to be non-recurring or not part of the Company’s normal business activities, which are subjective determinations made by management and may not actualize as expected;Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share exclude costs associated with activities deemed to be non-recurring or not part of the Company’s normal business activities, which are subjective determinations made by management and may not actualize as expected;Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future increasing our cash requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring expenses that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect expenses attributable to COVID-19 that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect share-based compensation expense and therefore does not include all of our compensation costs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect Other, net, including investment income, loss on extinguishment of debt and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, that may increase or decrease cash available to us; andother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Expenses attributable to COVID-19 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include $1. 2 million in product donation costs related to the Company's COVID-19 relief efforts in the first quarter of 2020, which were not previously included in the Company's Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the three months ended March 28, 2020 as these were deemed immaterial to its first quarter 2020 financial results.  Given the significant increase in COVID-19-related expenses in the subsequent quarters of 2020, and to facilitate better comparison from period to period, management determined that it was appropriate to recast its previous first quarter 2020 Adjusted EBITDA calculation to include these costs. (3)Includes $1. 5 million in loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020. "#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-meat-reports-fourth-quarter-210500383.html#k3Y3SNJrC

2021-02-25 09:59:56#health#We’ve Gone Overboard Disinfecting Surfaces During COVID#https://news.yahoo.com/ve-gone-overboard-disinfecting-surfaces-095956819.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pNY.ZvAlIS.PDsITg0VArg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/fda4dbace30b17a840c07d7d2082c76e#en#0.0#news.yahoo.com#Ulises Ruiz/AFP via Getty A lot has happened over the past year, so you can be forgiven for not having a clear memory of what some of the major concerns were at the beginning of the pandemic. However, if you think back to the beginning of the pandemic, one of the major concerns was the role that surfaces played in the transmission of the virus. As an epidemiologist, I remember spending countless hours responding to media requests answering questions along the lines of whether we should be washing the outside of food cans or disinfecting our mail. I also remember seeing teams of people walking the streets at all hours wiping down poles and cleaning public benches. But what does the evidence actually say about surface transmission more than 12 months into this pandemic?Before addressing this, we need to define the question we’re asking.  The key question isn’t whether surface transmission is possible, or whether it can occur in the real world—it almost certainly can. The real question is: what is the extent of the role of surface contact in the transmission of the virus? That is, what is the likelihood of catching COVID via a surface, as opposed to other methods of transmission?There’s little evidence that surface transmission is a common way in which the coronavirus is spread.  The main way it’s spread is by the air, either by larger droplets via close contact, or by smaller droplets called aerosols.  As a side note, the relative role these two routes play in transmission is probably a much more interesting and important question to clarify from a public health perspective.  A member of the Hygiene Team sanitizes the doors at Rod Laver Arena during the 2021 Australian Open.  Mackenzie Sweetnam/Getty One of the best commentaries on COVID surface transmission was published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases in July 2020 by Emanuel Goldman, a professor of microbiology from the United States. As he described, one of the drivers for the exaggerated perception of the risk of surface transmission was the publication of a number of studies showing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles could be detected for long periods of time on various surfaces. You probably saw these studies because they received enormous publicity worldwide and I remember doing numerous interviews in which I had to explain what these findings actually meant. As I explained at the time, these studies could not be generalized to the real world, and in some instances the media releases accompanying them tended towards overstating the significance of these findings. The key issue is that as a general principle the time required for a population of microorganisms to die is directly proportional to the size of that population.  This means the greater the amount of virus deposited on a surface, the longer you will find viable viral particles on that surface. So in terms of designing experiments that are relevant to public health, one of the more important variables in these studies is the amount of virus deposited on a surface—and the extent to which this approximates what would happen in the real world. If you understand this, it becomes apparent that a number of these virus survival studies stacked the odds of detecting viable virus by depositing large amounts of virus on surfaces far in excess of what would be reasonably expected to be found in the real world.  What’s more, some of these studies customized conditions that would extend the life of viral particles, such as adjusting humidity and excluding natural light. Is Soap or Hand Sanitizer Best for Stopping Coronavirus?Although there was nothing wrong with the science here, it was the real world relevance and the interpretation that was amiss at times.  It’s notable that other studies which more closely replicated real world scenarios found less impressive survival times for three other human coronaviruses (including SARS). It’s important to note we’re relying on indirect evidence in assessing the role of surface transmission for the coronavirus.  That is, you can’t actually do an ethical scientific experiment that confirms the role surface transmission plays because you’d have to deliberately infect people.  Despite being such a seemingly straightforward question, it’s surprisingly difficult to determine the relative importance of the various transmission pathways for this virus. What we have to do instead is look at all of the evidence we do have and see what it’s telling us, including case studies describing transmission events.  And if we do this, there isn’t a lot out there to support surface transmission being of major importance in the spread of COVID. We need to put the risks of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via the various modes of transmission into perspective, so we focus our limited energy and resources on the right things. This isn’t to say surface transmission isn’t possible and that it doesn’t pose a risk in certain situations, or that we should disregard it completely.  But, we should acknowledge the threat surface transmission poses is relatively small. We can therefore mitigate this relatively small risk by continuing to focus on hand hygiene and ensuring cleaning protocols are more in keeping with the risk of surface transmission. In doing this, we can potentially save millions of dollars being spent on obsessive cleaning practices.  These are probably providing little or no benefit and being done solely because they’re easy to do and provide the reassurance of doing something, thereby relieving some of our anxieties.

Catalina Lauf, who served in the Department of Commerce under the Trump administration, launched a bid Thursday to oust Kinzinger from his seat in the 16th congressional district of Illinois.  “I never thought I’d primary a fellow Republican, but is Congressman Kinzinger really a Republican anymore? He isn’t and we have the proof,” the 27-year-old challenger said in a campaign announcement video.  Lauf said her 42-year-old opponent is a “weak-kneed, establishment Republican” who “cares more about his next MSNBC appearance than the voters who elected him. ” She claimed Kinzinger does not support the “America First” movement, noting his “one in three votes” in Congress that have sided with House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D. , Calif. ) “Instead of being in our fight, Adam betrayed his constituents for a life in the D. C.  swamp,” said Lauf, who branded herself the “anti-AOC. ” She blasts her “Fake Republican” opponent for backing the “phony impeachment hoax for a president who has already left office. ” “He said impeachment was ‘necessary to save America. ’ What?” Lauf said.  “You know what I think is necessary to save America, Adam? Setting term limits for people like you and the rest of your friends out.  Six terms in Congress is enough. ” Kinzinger is one of ten House Republicans who supported Trump’s impeachment on the charge of “incitement of insurrection” after a mob of the former president’s supporters stormed the U. S.  Capitol last month.  Others who supported impeachment, including Representative Liz Cheney (R. , Wyo. ) and Representative Anthony Gonzalez (R. , Ohio), are likely to face primary challenges from pro-Trump Republican candidates as well.  Gonzalez is expected to face a primary challenge from a former Trump aide, Max Miller, who served in the White House.  Miller has reportedly been in discussion with top Republican donors in Ohio and other Republican leaders since leaving the White House last month, according to Politico.  Miller, who is from northeastern Ohio, recently purchased a house in Rocky River, which is inside Gonzalez’s 16th district, according to the report.  As for Lauf, she says she will focus on a number of issues, if elected, including “social media censorship,” “election integrity,” “freedom of speech,” “gun rights,” “illegal immigration,” and “keeping the economy going. ” Lauf is the daughter of a Guatemalan immigrant mother and a small-business-owner father.  This marks Lauf’s second bid for Congress, having run in the 14th congressional district of Illinois in 2020.  State senator Jim Oberweis beat out Lauf in a crowded primary to become the GOP candidate, but ultimately lost in the general election against incumbent representative Lauren Underwood, a Democrat, by less than 2 percent. #https://news.yahoo.com/former-trump-aide-run-primary-133040029.html#PLU2m8W9x

When the retro game rescue crew at Nightdive first launched the Kickstarter campaign to remake System Shock in 2016, the studio ambitiously thought it could be finished in a year and a half.  That didn't happen, and early in 2018, the game far from done, they made the dramatic move of restarting from scratch, after straying too far from the original idea of a faithful remake. Three more years in, it's nearly finished: Pre-orders are available starting Thursday, and Nightdive's head of business development Larry Kuperman told me the launch isn't far off.  The plan is for System Shock to be out this summer.  A new demo, available for everyone to download today, represents a game that's finally almost at the finish line. The goal of the demo is to present a ""feature-complete version of the game,"" says CEO Stephen Kick, so players ""understand exactly what they'll be getting if they preorder. "" Kick walked me through what the demo includes that we haven't already seen from Nightdive's remake so far. ""Those features include a dismemberment system, so you'll be able to blow apart the mutants and cyborgs that are onboard Citadel Station,"" he said.  ""The lighting is now fully real-time so you'll be able to destroy the lights.  We wanted to make it as immersive as possible.  One of the other really big features that's available for the first time is cyberspace.  You can go into cyberspace, fight the various enemies that are there, and unlock doors that are in the real world that are protected by SHODAN in virtual reality. ""The demo also has new voice acting, more detailed environments, and dynamic music that will change out sections of a track rather than run on a loop.  It's more advanced than the original game's, and the new soundtrack will definitely have its own vibe, too. ""The original had a dynamic system that would change based on whether you were in combat or exploring.  We have that, we've recreated that, but the tone of the music has definitely changed,"" said Kick.  ""When you're exploring it's a lot more atmospheric, and not so much like you're in a '90s rave. ""But don't worry—parts of the System Shock remake's soundtrack will still be danceable.  Artist Evelyn Mansell pointed out that cyberspace is pretty ravey.

When it sank, the ship was carrying marble sculptures chipped from the badly damaged Parthenon in Athens — later known as the ""Elgin Marbles or Parthenon Marbles.  These spectacular sculptures — which depict Greek gods, heroes and animals — are now on display at the British Museum in London. Related: 20 of the most mysterious shipwrecks everBut the small objects recovered from the wreck reveal intriguing aspects of the lives of the people onboard the ship when it sank, said marine archaeologist Dimitris Kourkoumelis, of the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, a department of the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports. ""The target is to understand how people were living and how was life onboard, not only for the passengers but also for the crew,"" Kourkoumelis told Live Science.  ""We've found gold coins from Utrecht in Holland, as well as from Spain, and also coins from the Ottoman Empire — so it was really a cosmopolitan group [of people] on the Mentor.

The average U. S.  price of regular-grade gasoline jumped 14 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $2. 64, according to the Associated Press.  The price at the pump has climbed 46 cents since Nov.  20.  Some of the rise this past week was attributable to the deep freeze in the South, which temporarily shut down production at about a dozen refineries in and around Texas.  Resumption of production there could bring some temporary relief, but the long-term outlook is not as rosy. #https://fox8.com/news/analysts-say-gas-prices-of-3-per-gallon-is-real-possibility/#UcWgxytTf

When exactly those films arrive has yet to be determined, as the COVID-19 pandemic has repeatedly pushed back the release slates of dozens of blockbusters.  But for now, “A Quiet Place II,” which was originally set for release in March 2020, is set for release in theaters on September 17, while “MI7” is set for release in theaters on Nov.  19.  Paramount’s announcement comes as the pandemic has led Hollywood studios to experiment with the theatrical window that has been fiercely defended by movie theaters for decades.  Universal Pictures has signed a deal with AMC Theaters and Cinemark to release its films on PVOD as early as 17 days after theatrical release, or 31 days if the film grosses more than $50 million in its opening weekend.  Also Read: Here's Everything ViacomCBS Just Announced Is Coming to Paramount+ Warner Bros. , meanwhile, made the controversial decision to release all of its 2021 films on HBO Max for 30 days at the same time they are release in theaters.  Disney is also experimenting with the theatrical window, placing its animated film “Raya and the Last Dragon” in both theaters and on PVOD for Disney+ subscribers on March 5.  Paramount has sold distribution rights to several streaming services over the course of the pandemic, including Aaron Sorkin’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7” to Netflix and Eddie Murphy’s “Coming 2 America” to Amazon Studios.  But the studio has held on to its biggest tentpoles, delaying them in the hopes that theaters will be able to reopen this fall and allow the films to earn a strong return at the box office.  Combined, “A Quiet Place” and “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” grossed over $1. 1 billion worldwide during a resurgent box office year for Paramount in 2018, and the sequels, along with “Top Gun: Maverick” are part of the studio’s plan to rebound after struggles in 2019 and 2020.
