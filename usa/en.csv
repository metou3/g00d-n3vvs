(“BigCommerce”) (Nasdaq: BIGC), a leading open SaaS ecommerce platform for fast-growing and established brands, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.  “2020 marked a historic year for BigCommerce with our fourth quarter revenue up 39% year-over-year and our ARR increasing 41% year-over-year to $181. 2 million,” said Brent Bellm, CEO at BigCommerce.  “We remain strategically focused on serving the needs of merchants of all sizes, and this past quarter further illustrates our ability to disrupt the mid-market and large enterprise market segments with 51% year over year growth in enterprise account ARR. ” Financial Highlights Total revenue was $43. 1 million, up 39% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Total annual revenue run-rate (ARR) as of December 31, 2020 was $181. 2 million, up 41% compared to December 31, 2019. ARR from accounts with at least one Enterprise plan (“Enterprise accounts”) was $100. 8 million as of December 31, 2020, up 51% compared to December 31, 2019. ARR from Enterprise accounts as a percent of total ARR was 56% as of December 31, 2020, up from 52% compared to December 31, 2019. Accounts greater than $2,000 in ACV as a percent of total ARR was 82%, up from 78% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Net revenue retention for accounts greater than $2,000 in ACV finished at 113% in 2020, up from 106% in 2019. New SMB, Mid-Market and Enterprise customers were added at an estimated LTV to CAC ratio of 4. 9:1, up from 4. 4:1 in 2019 Business Highlights Product Highlights: The Company continues to invest in building the best open SaaS ecommerce platform in the world, supported and integrated with the Company’s extensive network of best-of-breed technology and agency partners.  Fourth quarter highlights include:-- The Company further optimized the product for international markets by adding support for German, Dutch, Portuguese, and Swedish to its merchant admin panel and a native integration to global payments partner, Checkout. com. -- It bolstered its Open SaaS strategy by introducing Storefront API powered by GraphQL, which is optimized for headless implementations including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), native mobile experiences and Content Management Systems (CMSs). -- The Company completed the rollout of Channel Manager in October, a unified hub to help merchants streamline listing and selling products on third-party sales channels via seamless integrations with Amazon, eBay, Wish, Google, and Facebook/Instagram to help amplify merchant reach to millions of shoppers.  In parallel, the Company launched Channels Toolkit, -- a toolset composed of APIs, resources, and tools -- that enables partners and developers to deeply integrate third-party channels. Merchant Highlights: The Company added leading brands across multiple industries including HoMedics, a leader in home health wellness innovations; HMD Global, the official licensee of Nokia brand mobile phones and services; and Spiceology, one of the fastest-growing private spice companies in America. Partner Highlights: Our ecosystem grew to include integration with PayPal’s newly acquired EMEA point-of-sale platform, iZettle; leading ads provider Teikametrics; and subscription billing solutions Sticky. io and Recharge.  As previously announced, BigCommerce partnered with Wish to expand our merchants’ sales channels to include one of the largest global Marketplaces. Team/Culture: BigCommerce was proud to be recognized as a Top WorkPlace by the Austin American-Statesman for the 9th year in a row, in addition to numerous other awards received in 2020, such as Great Place to Work Australia and San Francisco Bay Area’s Best and Brightest Companies.  Fourth Quarter Financials: Other Key Business Metrics Number of accounts greater than $2,000 in annual contract value (ACV) was 10,184, up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Average revenue per account (ARPA) of accounts greater than $2,000 in ACV was $14,615, up 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.  Operating Income/(Loss) GAAP operating loss was ($13. 8) million, compared to ($9. 8) million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP operating loss was ($7. 6) million, compared to ($8. 8) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Net Income/(Loss) and Earnings Per Share GAAP net loss was ($14. 2) million, compared to ($10. 3) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Non-GAAP net loss was ($8. 0) million or (18%) of total revenue, compared to ($9. 4) million or (30%) of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The nearly 12 point improvement in non-GAAP net loss as a percent of revenue was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving further leverage in the business as the Company continues to scale. GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 21) based on 68. 6 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($0. 68) based on 18. 0 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 12) based on 68. 6 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($0. 52) based on 18. 0 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was negative ($6. 8) million, compared to ($8. 1) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively and drive operating leverage in R&D and sales and marketing spending.  Fiscal Year 2020 Financials: Total revenue was $152. 4 million, up 36% compared to fiscal year 2019.  Operating Income/(Loss) GAAP operating loss was ($38. 7) million, compared to ($41. 0) million in fiscal year 2019. Non-GAAP operating loss was ($27. 4) million, compared to ($37. 8) million in fiscal year 2019.  Net Income/(Loss) and Earnings Per Share GAAP net loss was ($37. 6) million, compared to ($42. 6) million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss was ($30. 7) million or (20%) of total revenue, compared to ($39. 4) million or (35%) of total revenue in fiscal year 2019.  The nearly 15 point improvement in non-GAAP net loss as a percent of revenue was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving further leverage in the business as the Company continues to scale. GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 99) based on 39. 1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($2. 80) based on 17. 8 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal year 2019. Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 79) based on 39. 1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($2. 21) based on 17. 8 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal year 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was ($24. 5) million, compared to ($35. 5) million in fiscal year 2019.  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving operating leverage in R&D and sales and marketing spending.  This increase was partially offset by higher costs in G&A primarily due to public company expenses.  Cash Cash and cash equivalents totaled $219. 4 million as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was ($26. 5) million, compared to ($40. 0) million for the same period in 2019. Free cash flow was ($28. 5) million, compared to ($45. 5) million for the same period in 2019.  Q1 and 2021 Financial OutlookFor the first quarter of 2021, the Company currently expects: Total revenue between $41. 8 million and $42. 3 million. Non-GAAP operating loss between ($8. 2) million and ($7. 9) million.  For the full year 2021, the Company currently expects: Total revenue between $189. 0 million and $191. 0 million. Non-GAAP operating loss between ($34. 5) million and ($33. 3) million.  The Company’s first quarter and 2021 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the Company’s control.  If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change.  There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.  The Company does not provide guidance for operating loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating loss, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share and these comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items.  These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “outlook,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy, “target,” “explore,” “continue,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements.  However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.  These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q1 and 2021 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies.  By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.  These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others, our business would be harmed by any decline in new customers, renewals or upgrades, our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future results of operations, we operate in competitive markets, we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future, our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform or certain social media platforms, and a cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks could negatively affect our business.  Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our final prospectus under Rule 424(b) filed with the SEC, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC and the future quarterly and current reports that we file with the SEC.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to BigCommerce at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events.  BigCommerce assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.  Annual revenue run-rate We calculate annual revenue run-rate (“ARR”) at the end of each month as the sum of: (1) the product of the current month’s monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) multiplied by twelve (to prospectively annualize subscription revenue), and (2) the trailing twelve-month partner and services revenue, including non-recurring services revenue, such as one-time partner integration fees and store-launch services.  MRR includes BigCommerce platform subscription fees and invoiced growth adjustments as customers’ businesses grow past contracted order thresholds after a threshold has been met.  It also includes recurring professional services revenue, such as recurring technical account management services and product training services.  Accounts with greater than $2,000 ACV We track the total number of accounts with annual contract value (“ACV”) greater than $2,000 (the “ACV threshold”) as of the end of a monthly billing period.  To define this $2,000 ACV cohort, we include only subscription plan revenue and exclude partner and services revenue and recurring services revenue.  We consider all stores added and subtracted as of the end of the monthly billing period.  This metric includes accounts that may have either one single store above the ACV threshold or multiple stores that together exceed the ACV threshold.  Accordingly, this cohort would include: (1) customers on Enterprise plans, (2) customers on Pro plans, and (3) customers with multiple plans that together exceed the ACV threshold.  Average revenue per account We calculate average revenue per account (ARPA) for accounts above the ACV threshold at the end of a period by including customer-billed revenue and an allocation of partner and services revenue.  Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, changes in fair value of financial instruments, and our provision for income taxes.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.  Non-GAAP Operating Loss We define Non-GAAP Operating Loss as our GAAP Loss from operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our loss from operations.  Non-GAAP Net Loss We define Non-GAAP Net Loss as our GAAP net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our net loss.  Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share We define Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share as our Non-GAAP Net Loss, defined above, divided by our basic and diluted GAAP weighted average shares outstanding.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our net loss per share.  Free Cash Flow We define Free Cash flow as our GAAP cash flow from operating activities plus our GAAP purchases of property and equipment (Capital Expenditures).  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our cash flow from operating activities.

This week we posed the following question to 1,000 Benzinga readers on the 2021 price action of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE).  Over the next year, which cryptocurrency will have the largest percentage gain? Bitcoin 37% Ethereum 32% Dogecoin 31% As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been hitting new highs in recent months.  Bitcoin trades around $53,000 at time of publication, off the all-time high of $58,300.  See Also: Is Bitcoin A Good Investment? Experts in crypto like Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, believe the price of Bitcoin is going to reach 0,000 by the end of the year.  Ethereum expands upon Bitcoin’s infrastructure in terms of useability.  Instead of only transferring coins between wallets, Ethereum’s network supports the creation of decentralized applications, or DApps, that allow users to execute agreements with one another without the use of a middleman.  Ethereum trades around $1,750 at publication time, off the all-time high of $2,036.  Meanwhile, Dogecoin is built on the same basic technology as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  The Shiba-Inu based cryptocurrency was introduced as a joke in 2013 to help raise public awareness of the capabilities of blockchain technology.  Now, Dogecoin is catching on with celebrities from Elon Musk to Gene Simmons.  Dogecoin trades around 5 cents and has an all-time high of $0. 087.

Yet the cards have been spotted in online stores all across the map early, and it wouldn't be surprising to hear people are rushing to snatch them up. According to VideoCardz, a seller named Artem had three Gigabyte Eagle RTX 3060 cards on sale in Belarusian store Onliner over the weekend.  The sale page has since disappeared, now throwing up a 404, but I'd bet these cards sold for their listing price of $1,080 each (in USD equivalent cash).  That is, if they weren't pulled beforehand. What's really funny about this listing is that these sale images clearly show the serial numbers.  That makes it a doddle for Gigabyte to trace the cards and find out exactly where they slipped off the truck.  Perhaps it's only a matter of time before someone gets the sack. #https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-reseller-1000-dollars/#ge30hWtB5

Today it dropped a trailer showcasing the new mode in action, along with a blog post detailing how it's all going to work. The trailer isn't much to write home about, I don't think: Gunfire, explosions, zombies, and generic one-liners delivered flatly by voice actors who sound like they're reading from the phone book, while a classic rock remix plays in the background.  The blog post is a different story, however.  There's plenty of narrative background if you're into that sort of thing, and more practically there's also a breakdown of how the new mode will actually play. Squads of up to four players will be inserted into the Outbreak zone and given one of five objectives to investigate and complete.  How you approach these objectives is entirely up to you: You can take any route to get there, and as much time as you like along the way.  Exploring the region will uncover rewards in loot chests, trigger random encounters, and open up Trial Computers. More types of missions are expected to be added as Outbreak grows and evolves, but for now, this is what you'll be getting up to:"#https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-details-how-call-of-duty-cold-wars-zombies-outbreak-mode-will-actually-work/#ewwo6OIuk

First among the measures is the establishment of a comprehensive national database to record and track the state-authorized clergy of the five authorized religions (Protestant Christianity, Roman Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism, and Taoism).  Any dissenting member of the clergy not registered in this database will be in immediate violation of the law.  As Nina Shea observes, in order to register in the first place, clergy will have to demonstrate that they “support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and support the socialist system. ” Their loyalty to the CCP will then be periodically assessed in a manner similar to the country’s broader social-credit system.  These measures are further evidence of the CCP leadership’s eagerness to avoid the tactical mistakes made by the Soviet Union last century.  The Chinese Communists aren’t trying to extirpate every last trace of theism, thereby inviting the undivided opposition of religious believers and institutions (as the Soviets did with regard to John Paul II’s Vatican).  Instead, they’re attempting to enervate religious opposition to the regime by taming and co-opting domestic religious belief, turning it into another thoroughfare for the regime’s agenda of social control.  For this reason, Chairman Xi has prioritized the “sinicization” of religion in China, all but mandating the prominent presence of his own likeness in every house of worship.  The tactical approach that the CCP has taken toward the Roman Catholic Church is particularly instructive of how party policy on religion differs from that of Communist regimes past (and even present if one considers the Kims in North Korea).  Instead of trying to drive the Catholic Church out of China altogether, the CCP seeks to increase its own influence over the Vatican.  (They’ve taken exactly the same approach toward many other things like American sports leagues, international institutions, and even capitalism itself. ) On September 22, 2018, the CCP signed an agreement with the Vatican — the text of which is still secret — according to which the two parties agreed to “cooperate” in the selection of Chinese bishops.  In practice, this has basically meant that the Chinese have presented their approved candidates to the pope, who then officially approves them, almost as a formality.  The whole affair reflects very poorly on Pope Francis and the Vatican hierarchy.  The hope was to allow Chinese Catholics worshipping underground to come out of hiding and live out their faith in public; but this “liberation” has been purchased at the price of ceding all control over Chinese Catholicism to a militantly atheist cabal of genocidal communists.  The naïveté of the Vatican in agreeing to such an arrangement has been exposed to the fullest extent by these new “administrative measures”: Article 16 says that bishops in China will be democratically elected through the state-controlled Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and consecrated by the Chinese Catholic Bishops Conference.  No reference at all is made to the pope or the Vatican, who’ve been completely excised from the process.  The CCP has cemented its sole control over Chinese Catholicism with the formal backing of the Catholic Church itself (the 2018 deal was renewed last year), leaving Chinese Catholic dissenters from the Party without even the formal backing of their own church.  In other words, this isn’t your grandfather’s evil empire.  The CCP are smarter, defter, and more economically dominant than the Bolsheviks ever were.  And right now, they’re succeeding at drafting Catholicism, along with the other major religions of the world, into the service of Marxism, something that even Marx himself didn’t think was possible.  As China’s only serious geopolitical rival, the United States also happens to be the most religious country in the developed world and the only country that sees religious liberty as the first and most precious jewel in its constitutional crown.  If any nation on Earth with geopolitical heft is to take serious offense at China’s war on religious freedom, it’s likely to be the U. S.  And yet there appears to be no appetite among the American public for a full-scale geostrategic conflict with China.  Policy proposals for a new Marshall Plan to compete with the CCP’s Belt and Road Initiative aren’t forthcoming in our public conversations.  Worse than that, the U. S.  hasn’t even been able to muster the collective will to offer American visas to Hong Kongers.  The Cold War consciousness that underpinned our enmity toward the Soviets last century is simply not an animating force today, even though Communist China arguably poses an an even greater challenge to the free world than the Soviets did.  The most likely explanation for this has to do with the CCP’s signature tactic, as discussed above: They prefer to co-opt and manipulate people and forces instead of destroying them.  During the last few decades, they’ve done precisely this with respect to free trade and global capitalism.  Chinese producers have gotten their hooks deep into American consumers and have made the Party an indispensable part of the American (and world) economy.  The CCP is deeply involved in our daily lives as consumers in a way that the Soviets never were.  By making American consumers their economic vassals, the Chinese have neutered any appetite for full-scale geopolitical conflict among America’s governing elite, who are terribly aware of what a policy of decoupling would likely mean for their own electoral prospects.  If voters are offered freedom from economic complicity in Communist atrocities in exchange for higher prices, are we sure they’d take the high road? One really has to wonder whether or not the first Cold War would have ended the way it did if the Soviets held sway over prices in the American marketplace.  The Chinese Communists haven’t tried to destroy capitalism.  They’ve prioritized state ownership of the mind and soul over state ownership of the means of production, and they’ve been more than happy to use capitalism to achieve that end.  We in the free world were convinced after the fall of the Soviet Union that economic and political freedom were necessarily joined at the hip.  We therefore sought the liberalization of the global economy in the earnest belief that political freedom would follow.  It never occurred to us that the Communists of the future might not be interested in nationalizing railroads or post offices but in nationalizing childhood, love, death, sex, and Jesus Christ — and in using the almighty dollar to do so.  We never considered the possibility that the 21st century could turn out to be the hideous lovechild of Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping.  Well, to borrow a phrase from Solzhenitsyn, the great truth has now dawned, especially for religious Americans.  We in the free world have made the Chinese Communist Party the most powerful producer and consumer in a global capitalist economy.  In one of human history’s cruelest ironies and most perfidious paradoxes, Xi Jinping now bestrides the world as a Marxist robber-baron, a creature whose existence has eluded our categories of political thought for the last 200 years.  With every new revelation of the CCP’s crackdown on religious believers, religious Americans are faced afresh with the fact that even an innocuous trip to Walmart might amount to an in-kind contribution to the massacre of the holy innocents; that the money we spend on our household goods is going into the pockets of latter-day Neros and Diocletians.  It’s been said that, with respect to China, Americans will have to choose between free trade and free markets, since China’s policy is to make markets unfree.  It’s even more true that, with respect to China, religious Americans will have to choose between free trade and religious liberty, because as of right now, American believers are unwittingly funding the martyrdom of their co-religionists.  Christianity (and most of the world’s great faiths) looks upon the faithful as an indivisible, supranational body.  For this reason, religious Americans must lead the charge to decouple from China economically.  They know that short-term national economic interests of the United States are worth nothing more than ash and sand when compared with the integrity and communion of the faithful.  If American believers persist in their acquiescence to China’s hold over the American consumer in spite of this knowledge, they shouldn’t be surprised to be greeted with a stunning flash of celestial light the next time they’re on their way to Costco, and with a voice crying out, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”#https://news.yahoo.com/second-cold-war-religious-americans-113023625.html#R0loNPjYq

Despite the warning, “the coordination and planning by authorities across the broader energy sector were seemingly disproportionate to the severity of the situation,” Vistra said in an emailed statement late Sunday.  The company didn’t identify which state entities it contacted.  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas is the state’s grid operator, while the Texas Public Utility Commission regulates power generators. Ercot said in a statement its “operating notices incentived all available generation to serve customers” and didn’t immediately comment on the Vistra letter.  Andrew Barlow, an official with the PUC, said he wasn’t privy to any correspondence between the agency and Vistra and referred the matter to Ercot. “Days ahead of this event, Vistra and others forecasted insufficient generation would be available, and we began winter emergency preparations,” the statement said.  “The warning signs were there, but the public was unaware of the gravity of the situation, which led to people being unable to respond and make the necessary adjustments for their families. ”Read more: How Extreme Cold Turned Into a U.

N.  investigators.  A confidential U. N.  report obtained by The New York Times and delivered by investigators to the Security Council on Thursday reveals how Prince deployed a force of foreign mercenaries, armed with attack aircraft, gunboats and cyberwarfare capabilities, to eastern Libya at the height of a major battle in 2019.  As part of the operation, which the report said cost $80 million, the mercenaries also planned to form a hit squad that could track down and kill selected Libyan commanders.  Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Prince, a former Navy SEAL and the brother of Betsy DeVos, Trump’s education secretary, became a symbol of the excesses of privatized American military force when his Blackwater contractors killed 17 Iraqi civilians in 2007.  In the past decade he has relaunched himself as an executive who strikes deals — sometimes for minerals, other times involving military force — in war-addled but resource-rich countries, mostly in Africa.  During the Trump administration, Prince was a generous donor and a staunch ally of the president, often in league with figures like Steve Bannon and Roger Stone as they sought to undermine Trump’s critics.  And Prince came under scrutiny from the Trump-Russia inquiry over his meeting with a Russian banker in 2017.  Prince refused to cooperate with the U. N.  inquiry; his lawyer did not respond to questions about the report.  Last year the lawyer, Matthew Schwartz, told The Times that Prince “had nothing whatsoever” to do with military operations in Libya.  The accusation that Prince violated the U. N. ’s arms embargo on Libya exposes him to possible U. N.  sanctions, including a travel ban and a freeze on his bank accounts and other assets — though such an outcome is uncertain.  The report raises the question of whether Prince played on his ties to the Trump administration to pull off the Libya operation.  It describes how a friend and former business partner of Prince traveled to Jordan to buy surplus, American-made Cobra helicopters from the Jordanian military — a sale that ordinarily would require U. S.  government permission, according to military experts.  The friend, Christiaan Durrant, assured officials in Jordan that he had “clearances from everywhere” and that his team’s work had been approved “at the highest level,” the report found.  But the Jordanians, unimpressed by those claims, stopped the sale, forcing the mercenaries to source new aircraft from South Africa.  A Western official, speaking to The Times on the condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss confidential work, said the investigators had also obtained phone records showing that Prince’s friend, Durrant, made several calls to the main White House switchboard in late July 2019, after the mercenary operation ran into trouble.  The Western official said it was unclear whom Durrant sought to contact, or if he got through.  Contacted through his Facebook page, Durrant declined to comment and referred to a statement he issued to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  last September.  “We don’t breach sanctions; we don’t deliver military services, we don’t carry guns, and we are not mercenaries,” it said.  The sheer breadth of evidence in the latest U. N.  report — 121 pages of code names, cover stories, offshore bank accounts and secretive weapons transfers spanning eight countries, not to mention a brief mention of a Hollywood friend of Prince — provides a glimpse into the secretive world of international mercenaries.  Libya began to fracture a decade ago, when the violent ouster of the country’s longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, set in motion a political crisis that splintered the country into armed factions, many eventually supported by foreign powers hoping to shape the destiny of the oil-rich North African nation.  Eastern Libya is now in the hands of Khalifa Hifter, the powerful militia commander whom Prince agreed to support, according to the report, as the country was wracked by fighting in 2019.  A one-time CIA asset who returned from exile in Virginia after the fall of Gadhafi in 2011, Hifter rapidly established himself in the eastern city of Benghazi as an aspiring strongman who was determined to blast his way to power if necessary.  In his late 70s, Hifter has relied for years on the United Arab Emirates for funding, armed drones and a range of powerful weapons, according to successive U. N.  reports.  More recently, Hifter has also received backing from Russia, in the form of mercenaries with the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group that has become an integral part of his war machine.  In April 2019, Hifter launched a blistering assault on the capital, Tripoli, but formidable obstacles stood in his way, including newly arrived troops from Turkey supporting the U. N. -backed government.  So Hifter turned to Prince, the U. N.  investigators found.  At a meeting with Hifter in Cairo, 10 days after the start of the campaign to seize Tripoli, Prince made his pitch for the $80 million mercenary operation, the U. N.  inspectors revealed.  Four days later, Trump publicly endorsed Hifter, reversing American policy toward Libya and supporting the assault on Tripoli.  But the mercenary operation turned to disaster just months later.  No sooner had 20 mercenaries arrived in Benghazi in June 2019 — Britons, Australians, South Africans and one American — than they became embroiled in a dispute with Hifter, who accused them of failing to deliver promised American-made Cobra helicopters, the report found.  Tensions rose and, on June 29, the mercenaries bailed out of Libya by boat on an arduous 40-hour journey across the Mediterranean until they reached safety in Malta.  But key elements of the mercenary mission — a cyberwarfare team that arrived separately and several attack aircraft — remained in Libya, the report said.  And the fleeing soldiers of fortune left behind a long trail of paperwork that eventually led U. N.  investigators to Prince.  A PowerPoint presentation shown to Hifter and reproduced in the report lists possible “high value targets” for assassination, including Abdulrauf Kara, a major commander in Tripoli, and two other Libyan commanders who hold Irish passports, suggesting the mercenaries were ready to hit European Union citizens if necessary.  A welter of contracts detailed in the report show how Prince moved three aircraft into Libya at short notice, transferring one for a nominal sum of $10.  There are also hints of a certain self-regarding bravado inside the group.  The report said that on a trip to Jordan, Durrant, the friend and former partner of Prince, used the cover name Gene Rynack — close to Gene Ryack, the cowboy pilot played by Mel Gibson in the movie “Air America,” about a CIA airline that smuggled drugs and weapons during the Vietnam War.  In fact, Prince knows Gibson and hosted him in Abu Dhabi for a couple of days in 2013, said Gregg Smith, a former Marine who worked with Prince at the time.  Prince has been angling for military business in Libya since 2013, mostly through Hifter, the report says.  In 2015, Prince supplied the Libyan commander with a private jet, owned by Hong Kong-based Frontier Services Group company led by Prince, and which Hifter used for travel to meetings in Egypt and across the region, the report says.  That same year Prince pitched the European Union on a private military force to patrol Libya’s borders and combat illegal migration.  The Europeans declined.  To the outside world, the mercenaries claimed to be working on a geological survey or an oil and gas project.  The report says that Bridgeporth, a British survey company then owned by Prince, was used to manufacture cover stories — just as the company had been used as cover for previous mercenary operations in South Sudan and Uganda.  Travis Maki, an American pilot who once worked for Bridgeporth, told U. N.  investigators that he flew one of Prince’s planes into Libya just before the operation.  The plane, a Pilatus PC-6, had previously been used by Prince during his Blackwater days, and is the same model used by Gibson’s character in the movie ""Air America. "" In Libya, it had been fitted with powerful optical sensors that made it a piece of military equipment, the arms inspectors concluded.  In an email, Mark Davies, the CEO of Bridgeporth, denied the company’s aircraft were used for anything other than surveys, and said that Maki had not worked for the company since 2018.  Prince's Frontier Group, which once invested in Bridgeporth, no longer held a stake in the company, he added.  Prince has faced accusations of violating international law before.  In 2012, U. N.  investigators accused his anti-piracy force in Somalia, the Puntland Maritime Police Force, of “the most brazen violation of the arms embargo by a private security company. ” Whether he will face sanctions as a result of the accusations against him, though, is highly uncertain.  Prince can no longer rely on allies with the Trump administration to protect him.  At the same time, a senior diplomat at the U. N.  said the Biden administration may be reluctant to penalize an American for breaches of the arms embargo when others are guilty of far worse.  In October, the European Union imposed sanctions on Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy Russian business owner known as “Putin’s chef” for his close ties to the Wagner Group mercenaries fighting in Libya.  But Prigozhin gets only a fleeting mention in the latest U. N.  report — perhaps because investigators, blocked by Russia, struggled to build a case against him.  On the other side of the fight, the report identifies Turkey — an ally of Libya’s internationally backed government — as a major violator of the arms embargo.  The big question about Prince left unanswered by the U. N.  report is who funded the $80 million mercenary operation he is accused of undertaking.  “He’s been linked to the Trump administration, the Emirati leadership and the Russians,” said Wolfram Lacher, a Libya expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.  “For me, the question is who is tacitly backing him?” Analysts and Western officials said the UAE was the most likely foreign funder of the Libya mercenary operation Prince is accused of launching.  The report points out that the mercenaries had offices, bank accounts and shell companies in the Emirates.  Moreover, the powerful ruler of the Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, has long-standing ties to Prince and is probably Hifter’s most important foreign backer.  Last year, the UAE poured tons of weapons into Libya in blatant disregard for the arms embargo, even as Mohammed traveled to Berlin for a major peace conference on Libya, where he posed with European leaders.  As with previous U. N.  investigations, the Emirates refused to cooperate with requests for information about the operation involving Prince and the mercenaries.  “They have yet to respond,” the report noted.

For a spacecraft to reach the Jovian system with enough speed to eventually achieve orbit around Europa, it had to either launch from a powerful rocket (which NASA lacked, limiting spacecraft to a space shuttle deployment) or be absurdly light (which the required radiation armor rendered impossible).  JPL engineers dashed out hastily written equations in chalk before driving fists against blackboards in fits of despair. Nothing for NASA was ever free… except for gravity assists.  Ordinarily, the agency could compensate for the meager speeds of heavy spacecraft by taking indirect flight paths and using planets encountered along the way to yank and shove the robotic pilgrim outward, inward, or onward.  The laws of physics being immutable, and the salient numbers known, NASA’s orbital dynamicists could do this all day, running the numbers to sling spacecraft precisely, one planet to the next: free propulsion from Isaac Newton.  It was incomparably the best bargain in space exploration. But then television tabloid journalism got involved, and everything became complicated. In 1997, while waiting at Cape Canaveral for liftoff, the Cassini mission was beset suddenly by political protest.  Cassini carried three radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which were powered by the decay of plutonium 238.  The plutonium wasn’t of the Back to the Future variety—a disquieting drop of Scary Substance Indeed into a homemade flux capacitor—but rather was stored in a ceramic form, wrapped in iridium, and caked in graphite.  It could not corrode, or be obliterated by heat, or vaporize, or disintegrate as an aerosol, or dissolve in water.  It was made to withstand not only the explosion of the rocket carrying it, but even a catastrophic reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.  Because it couldn’t vaporize, in a disaster situation, no one would inadvertently breathe it in and develop superpowers or extra appendages.  In fact, it was designed so that you could even eat the stuff.  The human body could not absorb it. NASA’s Mars 2020 Mission Could Rock Our WorldBut 10 days before three and a half million pounds of rocket thrust put inches between Cassini and Earth, a much smaller number—60, as in 60 Minutes—nearly nailed NASA to the ground.  The CBS TV newsmagazine aired a feature on the soon-set-for-Saturn spacecraft, Steve Kroft starring in the segment.  The correspondent’s opening line: “On October thirteenth, a Titan IV rocket is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral carrying seventy-two pounds of deadly plutonium; enough plutonium, in theory anyway, to administer a fatal dose to every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth several times over. ”And it got only worse from there.  Cassini was an afterthought in the story, and interviews from experts were interspersed with comments from… nonexperts, to be kind, but very well-spoken nonexperts, whose contributions—the generous ones! —included lines such as, “What gives anybody, including the federal government, the right to risk the population’s death or—or injury just for space exploration?”The segment featured a plutonium expert from the Department of Energy stating flatly that even if the rocket, spacecraft, and graphite-sealed, iridium-wrapped, ceramic plutonium blew up on the launch pad, it was literally impossible for the debris to do what protesters said it would.  But just to be balanced, Kroft’s menagerie of doomsayers described in lurid detail what plutonium—not in the form used by NASA, which you could safely sprinkle on your breakfast cereal, because, again, you could eat it—could do to the human body.  Among the highlights: “it can produce pulmonary cancer” and “you could have numbers like 100,000 or more people who develop lung cancer” and “if there is such an explosion, you can kiss Florida good-bye. ”Kroft even found a former NASA employee (“He’s neither a scientist nor an engineer,” admitted Kroft, “but…”) to lament publicly his role in endangering lives for such frivolities as space exploration.  “I feel guilty, quite frankly,” bewailed the penitent insider. To seal the deal, Kroft intercut the story with snippets of an interview with Wes Huntress, head of NASA’s planetary program, who had presided over the successful landing of Mars Pathfinder only months earlier. “This is from your own environmental impact statement,” said Kroft to Huntress—the tone of the host solid but affable, his countenance hard but eyes somehow benevolent.  “I want to read you a couple of things from it. ”Huntress was a pioneer in the study of interstellar clouds and one of the world’s foremost experts in planetary exploration, but he was not exactly tabloid-TV material, and after the cavalcade of activists arguing compellingly and without interruption, he seemed less than confident in his responses. Quoted Kroft: “If there’s an accident it talks about, quote, ‘removing and disposing of all vegetation in contaminated areas, demolishing some or all structures and relocating the affected population permanently. ’”“If there should be any such accident,” said Huntress, accurately but unhelpfully. Replied Kroft, “I mean, that sounds fairly drastic…” and Kroft waited patiently for Huntress, in possession of rope necessary to hang himself, to fill the silence, which 60 Minutes interview subjects always did, and he did, and did. “Well, the—what they’re probably talking about mostly is—is the damage on site, near the—near—near the launch pad because there’s clearly, when one of these things goes, a lot of damage near the launch pad. ”And after Huntress tap-danced and staggered—this guy didn’t even know what his own official Armageddon report said!—and at last swung gracefully from the gallows, well-honed doomsayers followed up, explaining precisely how Life as We Know It was drawing to a close, and kiss your babies tonight because our foolhardy quest to conquer the cosmos—Saturn! This pointless mission to a gas giant, whatever that meant—will leave mutated survivors fighting for the last canned goods on ransacked store shelves. Worse yet, Cassini would take a second swing at the peaceful people of planet Earth! If it didn’t blow up on launch, it was set to follow a VVEJGA trajectory to boost its way toward Saturn: that is, two swings by Venus (V, V), and then it would play chicken with the Earth, and if something went wrong. . .  (but if all went well, from Earth [E] to Jupiter [J] for a gravity assist [GA]).  US Air Force security police form a line to thwart protesters demonstrating against the planned Cassini nuclear powered spacecraft launch in front of the security fence October 4, 1997 at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force station.  The Cassini is a scientific spacecraft that will travel to Saturn on a five-year journey to orbit the planet and deploy a probe to the surface.  Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty The Clinton administration really did not have time for this but dutifully absorbed the panicked letters and optics of protesters grasping concertina-topped chain-link fences on Cape Canaveral’s perimeter, while on the inside, police lined up in body armor and carrying riot shields stared silently, just waiting to—what? Open fire? Brandish batons?Nevertheless, NASA went forward with its reckless rocket launch likely to leave only cockroaches crawling the Earth (or whatever some future species would call this planet), and things were fine, as they had been for previous launches dozens of times over.  But the message from headquarters to those filing future space missions: if you must launch radioactive material, do not plan trajectories taking the spacecraft back to Earth for a gravity assist.  Nobody needs the headache. Which meant, for Karla and company, years-long discussions on potential trade-offs for the Europa Orbiter mission, as it came to be called.  They analyzed other trajectories, other launch vehicles—anything to get more mass for a suitable science return.  What hardware do you make “rad-hard”—impervious to radiation (but expensive) —versus simply wrap in “dumb mass,” i. e. , big blocks of cheap protective shielding? What was the absolute smallest science payload possible? Ultimately, they found a relatively happy medium: a spacecraft that could launch direct and achieve the minimum science required to make a Europa expedition worthwhile, and NASA loved it, and then the cost doubled, and in 1999 Ed Weiler shot it dead.

She’s among hundreds of thousands of Americans who have lost their lives to the disease since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. Inchaustegui immigrated to the U. S.  from Cuba in the early sixties, shortly after Fidel Castro took control over the island on Jan.  1, 1959.  The Cuban Revolution unleashed the largest refugee flow to the U. S.  in history, and Inchaustegui was one of over a million Cubans who fled the island and came to the U. S.  in search for a better life. #https://news.yahoo.com/remembering-the-lives-lost-to-covid-19-carmelina-inchaustegui-77-of-miami-110113070.html#7E8wEygw4
