For nearly 20 years they have been renowned throughout the UK and Ireland for their plant-based diet plans, health food cafés, vegan ready meals and cookbooks.  But though more than half a million Instagram followers swear by their recipes, the twins’ children were surprised to see their fathers suddenly standing at the stove, making dinner.  “My daughter Elsie said, ‘Dad, I didn’t know you could really cook? I thought that was just for videos and stuff’,” says Dave Flynn, one half of The Happy Pear.  “We didn’t [used to] have to cook that much at home because we always had our cafés and restaurants, and why cook at home when there were chefs cooking really tasty food? “Then everything had to be cooked at home for the first time in 16 years, which was new for us.  We had to put what we’d been preaching for years into practise. ” Twins Stephen and Dave have been healthy lifestyle gurus since 2004 when they opened a tiny veg shop in their home town of Greystones with a dream to help people eat better.  It was well before the term “plant-based” had become mainstream, before the clean eating backlash, and definitely before Instagram had revolutionised how lifestyle influencers could reach the masses.  Sixteen years later, the brothers have a chain of cafés (all but one of which they had to close in the pandemic), a range of products in supermarkets, four cookbooks, a farm and coffee roastery and a series of online courses designed to help people get healthy and lose weight with a plant-based diet.  50,000 people have now used their health plans, and the brothers’ new cookbook, The Happy Health Plan, is a culmination of what they have learned trying to help others get healthy.  “We see day in day out the incredible feedback of people who go ‘Jesus, I didn’t realise what I was eating and what a massive effect it had on my energy levels’,” says Stephen.  “I remember there was a taxi driver in Dublin once who did one of our courses and he’s definitely not your quintessential plant-based yoga person.  He did one of our plans because he had had a heart attack and at the end of it he was like ‘I can’t debate it, my cholesterol has dropped, my blood pressure has dropped, I’m going to stick with this plant based life.  I can come off my statins. ’”#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/happy-pear-boys-taxi-driver-100930203.html#dLkp2WUlb

Stanley, a rescue dog, “really loves going on his daily walks, and has lots of puppy energy to burn off,” Lubbers said.  “It took about 45 minutes to get the boots on, and he managed to get three boots off over the course of our walk. ” Credit: Katelyn Lubbers via Storyful#https://news.yahoo.com/struggle-real-dog-attempts-walk-014438683.html#HKipSIO08

Believed to be capable of living more than 200 years, individuals as large as this one might have been on the earth when Charles Darwin made his famous journey in 1835 upon the HMS Beagle.  That historic journey brought Darwin to a world where the animals had been isolated from other populations of the same species.  Darwin observed that there were unique differences in the physical characteristics of the animals that differentiated them from the same animals on other continents.  It was these differences, or adaptations, that told Darwin that animals changed slightly from one generation to the next.  Darwin concluded that the physical changes were brought about by the differences in the environment and that required adaptation to increase survival.  Since the individuals that adapted were more likely to survive and more likely to pass on their genes through breeding, this created populations that possessed the same characteristics.  Simply put, this was the theory of evolution.  The finches and iguanas on these islands all have significant adaptations that help them survive in a harsh climate, as do most of the animals here.  These tortoises are no exception.  The tortoises are descended from the giant tortoises that roam Africa, but their shells are shaped differently.  During dry seasons, vegetation becomes sparse and the tortoises need to reach higher into the shrubs to access leaves and shoots.  Their reach of their long necks was limited by the shell behind their heads.  Those with grooves or indentations in the shell were able to reach higher.  Their increased survival meant that there would be more offspring produced by tortoises with this characteristic.  Incremental changes occurred over many generations to produce tortoises with the curved carapaces that we see today.  This tortoise has been spotted walking leisurely along the bike path on Santa Cruz Island in the Galalpagos.  A nature guide has stopped to capture video and to let his children see the tortoise as he passes on his knowledge about the fascinating animals.  Weighing as much as 220kg (485lbs), these enormous tortoises have little to fear when they are full grown.  Residents of the islands have great respect for the wildlife here and they understand the delicate balance that keeps their ecosystems running smoothly.  Tortoises are protected and interfering with them is avoided whenever possible.  A trip to the Galapagos Islands isn't complete without a close look at these ancient beasts. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/giant-galapagos-tortoise-takes-stroll-150003771.html#BpA4be9Gx

Also nicknamed ""the Mill,"" the natural ice cave of Glacier 3000 sits hidden below the snow-covered ground on a high-altitude glacier in the Swiss Alps - and it disappears only to reappear for a time every year. Glacier 3000 opened its first cable car to Tsanfleuron Glacier in the western Bernese Alps in 1959.  Since then, the company has expanded, offering visitors ski slopes, dogsled rides, a glacier flight, a suspension bridge, access to the Ice Cathedral and more.   The cave has been off-limits for quite some time, but visitors got the chance to venture inside for the first time recently. ""It's magnificent, but even that isn't the right word.  I've never seen anything like it.  Almost as [if] it's not of this world in fact.  It's magnificent, I can only recommend it if you have the chance to go,"" Helen Tromp, a resident who lives nearby, told Reuters after visiting the cave. Previously, access had been too treacherous to grant to the general public, according to a spokesperson. ""We discovered [it] maybe four or five years ago, but its access was too steep and dangerous.  This is the first time we can allow people to visit it, but under their own responsibility,"" Marketing Coordinator of Glacier 3000 Arnaud Magnin told AccuWeather in an interview. The frozen spectacle was created by Mother Nature as a result of a siphon effect.  In spring and summer, the cavity fills up with water from melting ice.  The accumulation of the water and residue blocks the entrance.  What was once an open cavern in the ice turns into a lake.  In the fall when temperatures begin to drop, the plug disappears, and the water spills out as in a siphon and gives way to a cave.  This unique process is where the name ""Mill"" originated, Glacier 3000 said. ""This cave is totally natural, the human has nothing to do with it and that is the reason why it is such a wonderful place,"" Magnin said. The spectacular structure is about 20 meters long, however, due to the unique way in which the cave is formed, its size and shape vary every year.  Frequent visitors could be treated to a new scene to explore and photograph each winter. But the cave isn't always safe to enter, and Glacier 3000 checks on the ice integrity on a daily basis to ensure the safety of visitors, especially to ensure that there is no risk of the cave filling with water. ""Our team checks every day the ice, and we will condemn the access way before the ice melts,"" Magnin said. Bernhard Tschannen, CEO of Glacier 3000, told Reuters that the cave was officially opened to the public for the first time in December 2020.  He explained that while the cave has existed in previous years, it was more steep. ""And this year it looks like an Ice Cathedral, so it's really beautiful,"" Tschannen explained to Reuters, adding that the cave's interior is quite flat this season, making access easier. Locals and visitors across the globe have been enjoying the newly granted access to such a one-of-a-kind natural wonder since its official opening in early December. ""People who enter feel the greatness of nature and its silence.  The light is also very special and makes the cave very impressive.  The photographers will take amazing pictures of another world, between earth and ice,"" Magnin said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APPBut people who enter to see the majestic views do so at their own risk, and the company's website spells that out clearly.  ""This ice cave delights lovers of atypical landscapes and photos, who can access it easily, but under their own responsibility,"" the company states on its website. After following a signposted path, visitors reach the cave's opening -- which is alluring, according to Magnin.  ""The entrance is small and seems like a hidden door.  That makes the experience more magical and unique,"" Magnin said. Changeable weather during the winter and the accumulation of snow in front of its entrance do not guarantee the feature's accessibility during the season - making the experience even more elusive. ""It's very impressive.  The vault is incredible.  Standing beneath it, you can just imagine the weight above.  It's beautiful,"" Brice Rozes told Reuters while touring the site.

""Although results are preliminary, the findings suggest we may have to book a larger venue for the mammal rave. ""At the Western Australian Museum, curator of mammals Kenny Travouillon borrowed a black light from the scorpion department and started looking for biofluorescence in their preserved mammal specimens.  He found orange and green accents in endangered marsupials called bilbies, bright white glowing in the quills of hedgehogs and porcupines, and signs of fluorescence in one of two species of wombat.  ""Kangaroos didn't seem to do very much at all,"" he added. Jake Schoen, a conservation technician at the Toledo Zoo, tested the zoo's preserved platypus specimen then used a specially modified camera to photograph live Tasmanian devils.  ""The tricky part was having them sit still for a fraction of a second,"" he said, but when he did manage that with one of the animals, he captured a blue glow around her eyes, ears, and whiskers.  ""Presumably all of its skin is fluorescent,"" Schoen said. Though the discovery of biofluorescence in a wider variety of mammals than previously known is exciting — opossums and flying squirrels also glow under black light — researchers don't yet know if this quality has any significance for the animals themselves.  ""It would be incredibly surprising"" if these animals ""could make out these fluorescent patterns in any sort of natural lighting environment,"" Michael Bak at Sweden's Lund University told the Times.  He noted that human fingernails and teeth also fluoresce, for some reason. Schoen said he and his colleagues hope to eventually ""tease out whether or not this is actually an ecologically adaptive trait,"" and fluorescence ""may just be a coincidence. "" But, he added, ""it's certainly a lot of fun. "" Read more about the new class of biofluorescent mammals at The New York Times.

2020-12-30 13:15:10#tech#The gentle giants of the ocean: Behemoth whale sharks up close#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gentle-giants-ocean-behemoth-whale-131510380.html#https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2020-12/30/5fec7ec9f1b75b5bf1e5ff13/5fec7ec9f1b75b5bf1e5ff14_o_U_v2.jpg#en#1.0#www.yahoo.com#Few creatures on the planet inspire such awe and wonder.  They are the largest shark species, and the largest fish on earth.  These are whale sharks, behemoths of the deep and they are as mysterious as they are enormous.  They reach an incredible 16m in length (55 feet) and might weigh as much as 45,000kg (100,000lbs), yet they have never harmed a human.  Having no typical teeth, they are incapable of inflicting an injury on anyone.  Whale sharks filter the water as many whale species do, feeding on plankton, krill, fish eggs, and a few small fish.  Baleen are the giant combs that separate food from water as it passes through the gaping mouth of this shark.  They cruise through oceans around the planet, occupying all tropical areas.  They are capable of swimming vast distances and individuals have been tracked in waters on the opposite side of the globe during different seasons.  Scuba divers have a particular love and respect for these great beasts and they travel to places like the Galapagos Islands to meet them face to face in their own environment.  The currents around the waters off Darwin Island converge to bring food and a diverse and abundant assortment of marine animals.  The whale sharks follow these currents in the months of September to November.  They can be found swimming around the islands in remote waters.  Yet, scientists still do not fully understand these animals or what brings them here during this time.  Almost every whale shark sighted here is a pregnant female.  They are not feeding as they drift along on the currents and little is known about how and where they give birth.  Sightings of baby whale sharks are almost no-existent.  Whale sharks have no ability to fight predators.  Their only means of defense is to outswim them or dive deep.  They have been able to dive to a depth of 1,900m (6,200ft) where predators cannot follow.  Their reaction to humans is similar.  If undisturbed, they will tolerate divers swimming near them.  They occasionally exhibit curiosity and will change course to swim near people in the water.  If a whale shark is concerned about a scuba diver coming to close, they can easily swim much more quickly than any human, or they can dive and quickly be away from people.  These whale sharks have been spotted near Darwin Island in late 2019 and early 2020.  The divers studying these magnificent sharks were able to record incredible close up video as the sharks passed by them very closely.  It is hoped that when we learn more about them, and also how to fully appreciate them, our respect will bring important measures to help the whale sharks remain in our oceans.  To lose them forever would be an unspeakable tragedy. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gentle-giants-ocean-behemoth-whale-131510380.html#j95O260ul

2020-12-30 14:20:24#entertainment#The Tastiest Way to Cook Bacon#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cooked-bacon-different-ways-tastiest-045024782.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sDZQ1_hrNziY0TGNAtIoZw--~B/aD04Nzk7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/galvanized/e1e8c589a9ba2446f1eecf720f27d665#en#1.0#www.yahoo.com#When I was growing up, my mom was always the master of cooking breakfast with the microwave.  I was always amazed at how she could cook a huge bowl of scrambled eggs, followed by a plate of bacon, using the small little microwave in our kitchen.  After watching her magical microwave ways, I always settled for cooking bacon in the microwave as I got older.  It seemed like the most convenient method, and honestly, the easiest method for cleaning up grease. But now that I'm what one may deem an educated food editor, I had to question my former thinking: Was cooking bacon in the microwave the best way to do it? Not in terms of cleaning, because we all know bacon just gets messy and wafts in your kitchen for days.  But in terms of taste, is microwave truly king? Or are the other two methods—stovetop and oven—the better methods? And no, you do not want to grill bacon. Here is an easy step-by-step tutorial for you to follow!I put this logic to the test by cooking bacon in three different ways.  Here's what I have concluded to be the tastiest way to cook bacon. RELATED: Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox!Third place: StovetopWhile this seems to be the classic way to cook a few slices of bacon, cooking bacon on the stovetop was not up to par compared to the microwave or the oven.  To cook the bacon, I used a cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat.  I watched the bacon as it cooked, flipping the slices when it seemed appropriate to flip—usually after two or three minutes.  After the first flip, the bacon was still uncooked.  When it was ready to flip again, the bacon on the top still seemed uncooked.  But when I flipped it, the bottom was almost charred. Now I admit, I am not an expert at cooking bacon the stovetop, I've only done it a few times.  Bacon needs an even lower heat to cook on a stovetop and a longer period of time.  Yet, if bacon on the stovetop is going to be that fickle compared to the ease of cooking it in the microwave or oven, it seems almost pointless to cook bacon using this method. Once the bacon was removed from the pan, numerous parts were still completely uncooked—while other parts of the slice were burnt to a crisp.  It tasted fine—still salty and crispy like a slice of bacon—but it wasn't that pleasant to eat. RELATED: Your ultimate restaurant and supermarket survival guide is here!Second place: MicrowaveI admit, eating bacon cooked from the microwave does spark a hint of nostalgia for me.  But after tasting all three styles together, I don't think this is the best way to cook bacon.  I find that cooking the bacon for 3 minutes, waiting for 30 seconds, then cooking it for 1 more minute makes the bacon that perfect, crispy texture that I like.  However, parts of the slice were not thoroughly cooked all the way.  I found myself having some delicious bites of the bacon, while other bites were chewier, which made it difficult to even bite all the way through. While cooking in the microwave seems easier to control compared to the stovetop, it didn't end up at the top of my list.  There was still some inconsistency in the bacon's cooked texture, docking it to second place overall. First place: OvenIt may take longer to cook bacon in this way, but honestly, it's worth the wait.  Bacon from the oven is perfectly crispy and greasy, just like what I would expect from a diner.  The texture is consistent, and there were no parts of the bacon left uncooked—each piece was cooked evenly. To cook bacon in the oven, place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet.  Lay down the slices, and bake it in a 400-degree preheated oven for about 20 minutes.  If you like chewier bacon, check it at 15 minutes and see if it's to your liking.

Ringneck parrots are known for their talking abilities, but that doesn’t always guarantee that they will.  Ringneck parrots need to be interacted with daily and need a lot of mental stimulation so they don’t get bored.  They can get loud and do go through what’s called a bluffing stage.  If you’ve never owned a bird, I would not recommend this type of parrot as your first.  Always do your research before bringing home a parrot.  Ringneck parrots can live anywhere between 25 years of age and above. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/talking-parrot-says-choo-choo-220520251.html#p1qMKhoy8

Yet few could deny that the couple have had quite a year, snapping up a sprawling Californian mansion and signing a string of lucrative business deals.  Perhaps mindful of their triumph in the face of perceived adversity, the couple used their first Spotify podcast on Tuesday to send a poignant message to their supporters, telling them: ""Trust us when we say love always wins. "" They reinforced the message with a personal song choice, ""Amen, This Little Light of Mine"", by Karen Gibson and the Kingdom Choir, which was played at their wedding, as they wished listeners a Happy New Year.  ""Not a toast per se, but a song, which is about shining a light,"" the Duke said.  ""The message of this song is one we hold so dearly.  It's about using the power we each have within us to make this world a better place. "" The Duchess quoted Martin Luther King as she said: ""It was the music that we wanted playing when we started our lives together.  Because as we all know, 'darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that'. """#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/love-always-wins-duke-duchess-162346766.html#4A2VEmBZy

These islands are very new in geological terms, having emerged from the ocean due to volcanic eruptions 400 million years ago.  Barren and lifeless, they were simply chunks of cooled lava until the surface changed over many years to support the first plants.  They were followed long after by sea birds and then animals that found their way there on rafts of floating vegetation.  Very slowly, the islands became home to many species of plants and animals, cut off from the rest of the world by the great distance from other land masses.  Life here on the islands has evolved on its own line, with animals adapting to long periods of drought and hardship.  They have developed unique traits and physical characteristics that were important for the survival of the species.  The people of the Galapagos understand and respect the delicate balance of nature in this world.  They exist in harmony with the animals and interfere as little as possible.  They encourage others to respect this as well, and tourists are gently reminded to let nature take care of its own.  But the pelicans are one of the exceptions.  Large, strong birds with few predators, they have little fear of the humans who bring in their morning catch of fish and lobster.  They pelicans have learned that there might be scraps and entrails to be had when the boats come in to the harbour.  This fish market on Santa Cruz is a popular destination for tourists and also for the locals.  The pelicans are not the only creatures looking for a free meal.  Marine iguanas, giant frigates, herons, and also sea lions patrol the sidewalk and areas around the counter as the fishermen cut the fish and get it ready for sale.  Locals come for the opportunity of a fresh purchase, and also for the entertainment as the animals gather in great numbers.  Throwing the entrails in the garbage and taking them to the landfill will result in scavengers getting their meals there.  It makes just as much sense to toss the waste in the direction of the eager and hungry mob of animals at the counter.  The pelicans scramble to move out of the way as people walk through, but they quickly line up again, salivating and keeping a sharp eye on the fish.  As the pelicans are tossed a large chunk by the generous fisherman, they squawk in what sounds much like comical human laughter.  While in the Galapagos Islands, a trip to the fish market is an absolute must, especially with a camera. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/hungry-pelicans-galapagos-fish-market-150006242.html#giAZDgOb8

BBQ Portobello Burger With Grilled Peppers & Mayonnaise Makes 6 burgersIngredients4 grilled and steamed spring onions (see below) 1 lb.  5 oz.  portobello mushrooms Rapeseed or peanut oil for frying 2 finely chopped garlic cloves 1 tbsp butter 3 1/2 oz.  finely chopped day-old sourdough bread 10 fl.  oz.  BBQ sauce 2 eggs Pinch of sea saltTo Serve2–3 red (bell) peppers 6 burger buns Butter for the buns Lettuce leaves 2 1/2 cups of mayonnaise Fresh herbs, e. g.  marjoram, oregano and thymeInstructions1.  Grill and steam the spring onions as described below. 2.  Cut the mushrooms into 1/4 in.  cubes.  Heat the oil in a frying pan (skillet) over a high heat until it starts to smoke.  Add the mushrooms and fry them for 10–15 minutes so they develop some color. 3.  Chop the steamed spring onions, and, together with the garlic, add them to the mushrooms in the pan.  Add the butter and reduce the heat to medium.  Fry for a few minutes while stirring. 4.  Remove the frying pan from the heat and transfer the mushroom mixture to a bowl.  Allow it to cool. 5.  Add the finely chopped bread, BBQ sauce and eggs to the mushrooms in the bowl.  Stir so that all the ingredients are well combined, and add a little salt to taste. 6.  Take a handful of mixture at a time and shape into 6 round patties, either by hand or using a food ring.  Put the burgers in the fridge for at least an hour, preferably longer, then they will hold together better when you fry them. 7.  Preheat the oven to 350ºF. 8.  Light the barbecue and grill the peppers well all over so they go black on the outside.  I usually add the peppers while the fuel is still actively flaming – ideally over a wood fire.  (You can also grill (broil) the peppers in the oven on maximum heat until they are almost completely black. ) Transfer the peppers into a plastic bag and let them cool for about 10 minutes.  Then rub off the skin by massaging them while they are still in the bag.  Cut the peppers into equal-sized pieces. 9.  Take the portobello patties from the fridge and brush them with oil.  Fry them in a frying pan for a few minutes on both sides so they develop a nice colour and a crispy surface.  Transfer to an ovenproof dish and bake them in the oven for 10 minutes. 10.  Butter the buns on the cut surface and fry them quickly in a frying pan or grill them in the oven. 11.  Place a patty on the bottom of each bun.  Put a lettuce leaf, some pieces of grilled pepper and a generous splash of mayonnaise on top.  Finish off with fresh herbs. Grilled & Steamed Spring OnionsMakes enough for 6 burgersIngredients1/2 cup olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 spring onions (scallions)Instructions1.  Pour the oil into a ziplock bag big enough to accommodate the spring onions.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Put the bag next to the barbecue so it is close at hand. 2.  Light the barbecue.  Lay the spring onions on the grid while the charcoal is still actively flaming.  Cook the onions all over so the surface gets a little burnt. 3.  Using tongs, transfer the spring onions to the ziplock bag.  Seal the bag and shake it so the oil covers all the onions.  Leave them in the bag for about 20 minutes so they steam in their own heat.

Dinner In An Instant Best For: Comfort Food Short-CutsMelissa Clark's Dinner In An Instant (punny!), teaches us how to turn nourishing winter food feats into easy workweek feasts with the press of a button — from savory morning frittatas to chicken and dumpling stews.  Tackling TLC-style dishes can be fast, fresh, and easy with a little help from our favorite seasonal kitchen gadget and this delicious guidebook. Melissa Clark Dinner in an Instant Cookbook, $, available at AmazonLeek & Artichoke FrittataServes 4Ingredients1 tbsp unsalted butter, plus more for the soufflé dish 5 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 small leeks (white and light green parts only), halved and thinly sliced 1 tsp kosher salt, plus more as needed ½ cup milk 2 tbsp all-purpose flour 9 large eggs 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh basil or parsley ½ tsp finely chopped fresh thyme ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper ¾ cup (about 2 ounces) Gruyère cheese, shredded ⅓ cup marinated artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely choppedInstructions1.  Butter a 1½-qt.  soufflé dish and dust the sides with 2 tbsp of the Parmesan.  Set it aside. 2.  Using the sauté function, heat the 1 tbsp butter and the oil in the pressure cooker.  Stir in the leeks and ¼ tsp of the salt, and cook, stirring often and lowering the heat if necessary (and possible) to prevent burning, until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. 3.  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the milk and flour.  Then whisk in the eggs, basil, thyme, remaining ¾ tsp salt, pepper, and Gruyère. 4.  Turn off the heat and stir the artichokes into the leeks.  Then mix the leek mixture into the egg mixture.  Scrape that mixture into the prepared soufflé dish.  Cover it with aluminum foil. 5.  Pour 1½ cups water into the pressure cooker.  You can either place a steamer rack in the bottom of the pot and then lower the soufflé dish onto the rack using a homemade sling, or, if you have a rack with an attached handle, lower the rack and dish all at once.  Cover and cook on high pressure for 16 minutes. 6.  Allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, and then release the remaining pressure manually.  Using oven mitts, remove the soufflé dish from the pressure cooker.  Remove the foil. 7.  Heat the broiler.  Sprinkle the remaining 3 tbsp Parmesan over the frittata, and broil until it is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. Reprinted from Dinner in an Instant.

Simply VibrantBest For: ""I Can't Believe It's Plant-Based"" DishesBringing the heat to your vegetarian dining game for the iced-over months ahead is as easy as picking up a copy of Anya Kassoff's Simply Vibrant — the bright, plant-based cookbook is overflowing with healthy and imaginative seasonal recipe magic.  There's everything from savory sweet potato dumplings to hearty black-bean hummus burritos that will warm up this week's lunch to dinner plans. Anya Kassoff Simply Vibrant, $, available at AmazonSmoky Cauliflower & Black Bean Hummus Burritos Makes 6 to 8 burritos Black Bean Hummus Ingredients1 cup dried black beans, soaked in purified water overnight 2 bay leaves and/or 2-inch piece kombu (optional) 1 cup torn fresh cilantro leaves and stems 1/2 ripe but not mushy avocado, peeled and pitted 1/2 jalapeño, seeded and roughly chopped 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 3 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and freshly ground Sea salt and freshly ground black pepperSmoky Cauliflower Ingredients4 tbsp neutral coconut oil, divided 1 large yellow onion, chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets 1/2 jalapeño or other chili, finely chopped 1 tsp smoked Spanish paprika 1 tsp pure maple syrup 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lime or lemon juiceBurrito Ingredients6 to 8 homemade tortillas (recipe below) or large store-bought whole-grain tortillas or wraps2 cups baby spinach, microgreens, or chopped lettuce Fresh cilantro leaves 1/2 ripe avocado, cubed (optional) Juice of 1 lime (optional)Black Bean Hummus Instructions1.  Drain and rinse the beans and cover them with water in a medium pot.  Add the bay leaves and/or kombu, if using, and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.  Lower the heat to a simmer, partially cover the pot, and cook the beans for about 30 minutes, until they are soft and buttery but not mushy inside.  Drain the beans, reserving 2 tbsp of the cooking liquid for this recipe and storing the rest for future use in a soup or stew, if desired.  Let the beans cool and discard the bay leaves or kombu. 2.  In a food processor, combine the beans, cilantro, avocado, jalapeño, garlic, lemon juice, ground cumin seeds, and salt and pepper to taste.  Process until smooth, adding some of the reserved bean cooking liquid as you go to achieve a smooth consistency.  You’ll have more hummus than you need for this recipe.  Leftover hummus is great as a dip and on tartines or sandwiches; store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Smoky Cauliflower Instructions1.  Warm 1 tbsp of the coconut oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.  Add the onion, salt, and pepper, and sauté for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden and caramelized.  Remove the onion from the pan and set it aside. 2.  Return the pan to medium heat and warm the remaining 3 tbsp of coconut oil.  Add the cauliflower to the pan in a single layer, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until lightly browned.  Flip the florets and cook on the other side for another 3 to 5 minutes.  Continue to cook for a couple more minutes to achieve even caramelization. 3.  Add the jalapeño and paprika to the pan with the cauliflower and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until the cauliflower is golden brown.  Drizzle with the maple syrup and lime or lemon juice.  Sauté for a minute or two until the liquid reduces into a glaze.  Stir in the caramelized onion and remove the pan from the heat. Burrito Instructions1.  Place one tortilla on a serving plate and spread 2 tbsp of black bean hummus on top.  Add about 2 spoonfuls of smoky cauliflower, followed by a small handful of spinach or other greens.  Top with some cilantro, avocado, and lime juice. 2.  Fold the lower end of the tortilla over the filling, followed by the sides, and then roll it tightly into a burrito.  Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings.  I prefer to make fresh burritos right before eating, but you can also make these in advance to take with you and enjoy for lunch or at an outing. Sprouted/Whole Spelt Tortillas Makes 16 tortillas Ingredients3 cups sprouted or whole spelt flour 1 tsp sea salt 1 tsp baking powder ⅓ cup soft neutral coconut oil or other neutral vegetable oil 1 ¼ cup purified warm waterInstructions1.  Combine flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl.  Make a well in the center, add oil and water, and mix to combine, gradually incorporating flour into oil and water well.  Knead into a soft dough.  Cover and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. 2.  Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a thick rope.  Cut each rope in half, continuing to cut in this manner, until you have 16 equally sized pieces.  Make a ball out of each piece, flatten each with the palm of your hand and keep covered. 3.  Thoroughly warm a medium pan over medium high heat. 4.  Roll each piece at a time into a 6 to 7-in.  circle on a well-floured working surface.  Transfer one piece at a time into the hot pan and cook for about 1 minute on one side, until bubbles appear, and a few pale spots are visible on the underside.  Flip and cook for another 30 seconds.  Remove from the pan and keep wrapped in a clean kitchen towel. 5.  Continue with the rest of the tortillas, stacking them on top of each other and keeping them covered.  They are at best when used right away. Excerpted from Simply Vibrant by Anya Kassoff © 2018 by Anya Kassoff.  Photographs © 2018 by Masha Davydova.

They are large and powerful animals with the males reaching a weight of up to 46kg (102lbs).  Most Arctic wolves are found in northern Canada.  Artic wolves have relatively little fear of people, thought to be due to their infrequent exposure to humans.  Although attacks on humans are rare, a few documented cases exist.  The Arctic wolf's primary food source is the muskoxen and Arctic hares, although they also feed on caribou and lemmings.  Capable hunters, the Arctic wolf has been found on two occasions to have preyed upon polar bear cubs.  Beautiful animals, the wolf symbolizes bravery, as in the association with the hunter or the warrior in folklore.  They are a vital part of any ecosystem they are part of, maintaining a delicate balance of other animals such as hares, beaver, and caribou.  Without them, populations of other creatures would go unchecked and the result to the ecosystem would be disastrous.  Studies have shown that without wolves, some areas experience an overpopulation of beavers, and ultimately, rivers and watersheds are permanently changed. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/pack-arctic-wolves-settle-nap-155008859.html#Wg3LSz2lo

Brandy Rohlf, Jace’s mother, shared footage of the heartwarming encounter to Facebook. “[Jace] waits every day for the UPS guys to drive by,” she wrote in her post.  “If he is not outside waiting for them he sits at the window and watches for them.  They ALWAYS honk and wave and look for him in the window.  Today they stopped by and gave Jace a gift because they noticed his excitement when they drive by. ”Rohlf told Storyful that Angelman Syndrome, a rare neurogenetic disorder, causes developmental disabilities, difficulty with motor function and speech, and “a very happy and excitable demeanor. ”“The driver’s wife sent me a message and told me they can’t wait to go by our house,” Rohlf told Storyful. “It’s the highlight of their day too.

Ask a well-traveled friend where you should vacation in Spain post pandemic, and you’ll likely get an earful on Barcelona’s dreamy architecture, San Sebastián’s epic pintxo crawls, and Sevilla’s foot-stomping flamenco tablaos.  But here’s my hot tip as a six-year Spain transplant who travels to pay the bills: Some of the most exciting news in Spanish travel for 2021 is out of Cáceres, a sleepy medieval city located 180 miles west of Madrid. I first visited Cáceres in 2017, lured by the promise of porcine delights (acorn-fed ham! spicy patatera sausage!), orange tree-shaded plazas, and one of the best-preserved medieval enclaves in Europe.  Approaching the city, I remember gasping at the skyline, all right angles with its low whitewashed houses and 30-some towers, some nearly 1,000 years old.  Brick steeples and cupolas shot up between them, lending an aristocratic grandeur to the place.  Storks soared overhead. My first walk through the Ciudad Monumental, or Old Town, revealed sinuous streets lined with mansions, churches, and monasteries built from stone, a foreboding sepia-tinged maze built to last.  Perusing the placards on each historical facade as if I were touring a museum, I struggled to find a single building newer than the 16th century.  Ornate coats of arms hovering above doorways bore the seals of fairytale surnames that were fun to say aloud: Godoy, Saavedra, Golfín, and Ovando-Mogollón.  Everything was preserved as if in amber.  The only glaring signs of modernity came in the form of film crew vans and extension cords: The Old Town was being used as a Game of Thrones filming location. Cáceres peaked early and then sort of calcified.  Though the Romans, Jews, and Moors laid the city’s groundwork, erecting towers and installing cisterns (the one beneath the Museum of Cáceres is worth a visit), the city’s heyday was between the late 15th and mid-17th centuries.  It was during that period that explorers from the surrounding region—such as Hernán Cortés, Francisco de Orellana, and Francisco Pizarro—brought back shiploads of plundered riches from the so-called New World to fund the city’s opulent constructions. But then, due the royals’ financial mismanagement, the money dried up.  Simultaneously, Cáceres was caught in the crossfire of a protracted war over Portugal, forcing many residents to flee.  By the turn of the 20th century, the city was an impoverished, sparsely populated backwater ravaged by centuries of latifundism and neglect.  People only began giving Cáceres a second look in 1967, when the Council of Europe declared it the third most significant monumental ensemble on the continent, bested only by Tallinn and Prague.  UNESCO named it a World Heritage Site in 1986. The irony of Cáceres’s dark chapter is that it may have saved the Ciudad Monumental from ruin.  Had the city remained prosperous through the centuries, its Old Town would’ve been wrecked to make way for newer buildings. As the weekend unfolded, I was struck by how well suited Cáceres was to excursions from Madrid.  It had it all: stunning churches (I’ll never forget the view from the bell tower of Iglesia de San Francisco Javier), tasty tapas served with gusto, and hotels for every budget.  Toledo and Segovia are the most popular field trips from the Spanish capital, but while fascinating in their own right, they’re in-your-face touristy (think magnets and postcards in every corner shop).  Cáceres, by comparison, felt like a real vacation—it oozed Spanish history and culture without a tourbus in sight. After that trip, I talked up Cáceres to anyone who’d listen, but I didn’t have a pressing reason to return until earlier this month, when I got wind of a flurry of news developments: a hotel opening, a museum expansion, revamped official tours, and a new restaurant run by one of Spain’s top chefs.  Finally, I thought, Cáceres would get the international buzz it deserves.  But then it dawned on me: With leisure travel at a standstill and foreigners largely banned from visiting Spain, Cáceres’s biggest year in over a decade could potentially go unnoticed abroad, another blow to the already-hamstrung tourism industry.  Determined to spread the gospel, I bought a train ticket, packed a bunch of masks, and set out to see what there was to look forward to in Cáceres in the After Times. After ditching my suitcase at the NH Collection Cáceres Palacio de Oquendo, a reliable mid-range hotel housed in a 16th-century stone palace, I zigzagged up into the Old Town.  It was pin-drop quiet—no cars, no people, just the squeak of my shoes on the wet cobblestones.  My first stop was the Helga Alvear Contemporary Art Museum.  When I came here in 2017, I left scratching my head: The low-ceilinged medieval building housed confusingly conceptual art (a pyramid of multicolored balls, garments pinned to a folded rug), and the collection felt clunky and out of place.  The German art collector has since thrown money at the problem to the tune of €10 million.  Tuñón Architects (of MUSAC fame) are behind the renovation, which added 54,000 square feet to the existing 32,000.  From outside the building, I could make out Tuñón’s signature wooden slats peeking above the scaffolding.  “It’s going to feel like a completely new museum,” a representative told me over the phone, adding that it would open “sometime” in 2021.  “The new space will allow us to finally showcase large-format pieces from the collection that we weren’t previously able to display. ”The Helga Alvear is a five-minute walk from the heart of the old Judería, or Jewish Quarter, a tangle of narrow streets and white single-story houses huddled around the Ermita de San Antonio, originally the main synagogue.  “Jewish Cáceres” is one of several new niche-interest tours that the local tourist office will launch in 2021, alongside other itineraries like “Muslim Cáceres,” “Roman Cáceres,” and a route hitting the city’s most scenic viewpoints.  (Stop by the tourist office on the Plaza Mayor to inquire about tour schedules. )But perhaps the most thrilling developments of all are in Cáceres’s hospitality sector.  To be fair, there was already plenty to rave about: The city is home to one of Spain’s most exclusive design hotels, Atrio, presided over by Cáceres-born partners (in both business and love) Toño Pérez and José Polo.  Atrio’s rooms are dramatically lit and bear original works by Warhol, Tapiès, Ruff, and Saura.  Downstairs, Pérez runs a two-Michelin-star kitchen where Extremaduran delicacies like lomo doblao (Ibérico pork loin confited lard) and torta del Casar (a creamy, grassy ewe’s-milk cheese) are woven into tasting menus that will have you crunching on a tapioca “butterfly” filled with salmon mousse one minute and braised partridge draped with black truffles the next. The duo’s latest passion project, slated to open in the second half of 2021, is an 11-suite hotel catty-corner from Atrio called Casa Palacio Paredes Saavedra.  “It’s shaping up phenomenally,” Polo told me over coffee and meringues.  “The accommodations are going to be enormous.  One of the suites has a 215-square-foot bathroom—that, to me, is true luxury. ” Evidently Tuñón Arquitectos has had a busy year.  In addition to the Helga Alvear, they’re undertaking the gut renovation and redesign of this 16th-century mansion.  When it’s finished, guests paying upwards of €800 a night will be able to enjoy amenities like his-and-hers showers, heated floors, butler service, and deep-sink tubs cut from single slabs of Italian marble.  There are plans to turn the original subterranean cistern into a candlelit sauna and hammam. Pérez’s food is peerless in Cáceres, but cheap it ain’t.  So when the couple announced that they were taking over Torre de Sande, the middling casual restaurant next door, and opening an informal Extremaduran asador (grill restaurant) in its place, locals jumped for joy.  The space, which opened this month, is absolutely stunning.  Torre de Sande is named for the 14th-century tower it occupies, so you can imagine the bones: stone pillars, vaulted ceilings, rough-hewn stone walls.  In fact, Pérez and Polo rent the place from a viscount (!), who gave his blessing for them to queer-eye the place—hola, deliciously dim track lighting and black marble tabletops.  Covid willing, you’ll be able to enjoy Pérez’s smoky roast meats and locavore tapas outside on the ivy-fringed patio come summer.  But whether a trip to Spain is in the cards next year or in 10, Cáceres will doubtlessly still be there, standing proud. Where to StayAtrio is one of the most exalted hotels in Spain—with rates to match.  More affordable launching pads include the NH Collection Cáceres Palacio de Oquendo, situated 100 yards from the bustling Plaza Mayor, and Gran Hotel Don Manuel, a few blocks north of the Old Town.  Both hotels stand out for their genial service and hearty breakfasts yet are equally a bit frayed at the edges (chipped paint and flimsy towels—that sort of thing). Where to EatBeyond Atrio and Torre de Sande, there are few truly great restaurants inside the Old Town.  Take a six-minute taxi ride to Javier Martín in the Nuevo Cáceres neighborhood, and you’ll be rewarded with shockingly well-priced tasting menus and ample à la carte options ranging from Ibérico pork carpaccio to creamy lobster rice to Almadraba tuna tataki.  Far more casual, in the best way possible, is La Marina, a third-generation bar that churns out unapologetically old-school raciones like white gazpacho, eggs scrambled with lamb brains, and zarangollo, a zippy Extremaduran salad of smoky roasted peppers and good Spanish tuna finished with a garlicky vinaigrette and a few flicks of parsley.

Bexleyheath, London, resident Gemma McPherson was expecting a pair of shoes to be delivered when she got a notification on her phone that her front doorbell camera had been activated. “I knew someone was coming down the pathway.  I headed to the front door and I could hear what sounded like drums and singing,” McPherson told Storyful. Her son answered the door and collected the package from the deliveryman, said thank you, and sent him on his way. “Because I could hear something I decided to check on my Ring doorbell camera.  And to my surprise it was him, the delivery driver, he was so lovely, happy, festive, and cheery,” McPherson said. This video shows the delivery driver, Arnaud Helderal, walking up the driveway, singing a Christmas tune to himself as he taps on the package like a drum and dances a bit. McPherson posted the video to a local Facebook page and several people commented sharing similar experiences, and it became clear that Helderal had unknowingly been spreading holiday cheer to residences all around Bexleyheath. McPherson called DPD to let them know how pleased she was with her driver, and that she wanted to nominate him for an award to thank him for his incredible service. “The very next day after receiving the award of recognition, he turned up at my doorstep and gave my son who answered the door that day the mug he received from work,” she told Storyful. “We have seen him since and he has said how overwhelmed he is and how thankful he is,” she says, and that he has even stopped by since just to say hello.

They are a strikingly beautiful turtle with a shell that resembles a fallen leaf, and large owl-like eyes.  Capable of watching two things at once, their large eyes provide this turtle with very keen vision.  They inhabit the forest floor of heavily canopied areas in Vietnam and South East Asia, eating worms, insects, and fallen fruit.  Visual perception seems to be important to these small turtles as they readily feed on fruits and vegetables that are red, or brightly coloured.  They also seem to prefer overly ripe fruit, possibly also due to colour.  Although this turtle prefers to live near fresh water such as streams, it is a terrestrial turtle and does not live in the water.  These turtles reside at the Toronto Zoo in an elaborate and sizable enclosure that has fresh water, leaf substrate and a healthy population of these turtles for socialization.  Highly praised for both the living conditions for zoo families and their efforts to promote and fund conservation efforts world wide, the Toronto Zoo is an excellent organization.  The turtle in this video has just been fed.  Although his friends have also had their share, the lingering piece of his lunch on his beak has attracted the attention of one of his buddies.  He makes a beeline for the one with the food and helps him out by grabbing the morsel of food for himself.  The adorable little faces and expressive eyes make these turtles a joy to watch. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/worlds-smallest-turtle-gets-help-160003202.html#n2G2fxlxv

These tourists were aboard the FV FeBrina, a scuba diving liveaboard that took them around the remote waters in Papua New Guinea.  Exploring Kimbe Bay, they were treated to some to the most spectacular scuba diving in the world.  The coral reefs and ocean life are unrivaled in their beauty and diversity and the colours and sights beneath the waves are breathtaking.  But when they came up from an hour of exploration beneath the waves, they were surprised to be met by a few families from one of the remote islands.  They live off the land in a very traditional way with very little influence from the outside world and with very little exposure to technology.  Paddling out from their village in dugout canoes, the women brought fresh produce and coconuts.  In a form of commerce that is centuries old, the boat crew also provided the villagers with some essentials such as rice and cooking supplies.  They regularly donate books and school supplies to these island people as well, helping them with their own system of education.  The ocean provides the people of the islands with a lot of food also.  They spear fish and harvest sea cucumbers, crabs, and other edible creatures.  Life in this world has not changed much for the people in the past 100 years.  In fact, many remote highlands areas of Papua New Guinea made their first contact with white people from the outside world as recently as the 1930s.  A small group of prospectors were among the first people to make contact with isolated civilizations.  It had been thought that the geography of these areas presented such difficulty that people could not survive in the highlands.  This isolation of the peoples has led to the diversity in language, with Papua New Guinea having more than 826 separate languages.  These kids were fascinated by the very pale skin of the tourists on board the boat.  Although there was no ability to communicate with a mutual language, smiles, laughter, gestures and small gifts made interaction easy enough, and extremely enjoyable.  The villagers provided Dave with coconut and a delicious seaweed that went well together.  Dave entertained them with backflips of the stern and with his iPhone, which they used to take group selfies.  Kristy joked with one of the mothers as they all laughed at the ""kids"", including Dave and she shared her bag of candies with them.  While we can easily focus on the things that make us all different, it is equally important to focus on what makes us the same.  As these new friends demonstrate, laughter is the universal language.

There is great beauty and rich history, and only a few steps away, there is great poverty and hardship.  This is true for the animals here, as well as for the people and there are more than 5 million stray cows that wander the streets.  They seek food in composts and garbage bins and on vacant lots where a few blades of grass grow.  The cows are sacred to most of the people in India and their faith prohibits them from eating the meat of cows.  Impoverished farmers cannot afford to feed or care for the animals that they rely on for milk and the cows wander, eating what little they can find.  Unfortunately, cows often ingest garbage and plastic and their digestive tracts become blocked, causing them to become malnourished.  This prevents them from producing milk and they become more of a burden to the farmers than they can manage.  Farmers have little choice and they release the cows to fend for themselves.  The cows roam free, often relying on the kindness of strangers.  They are fed bread and table scraps by those who can afford to pass on some kindness for these gentle beasts.  This Canadian tourist has watched this dairy cow as she wanders, obviously looking for a meal.  She takes pictures of the unusual sight, but she cannot walk away without doing something to help.  She finds a nearby vendor who is selling alfalfa, a sweet grass that is high in protein and other nutrients.  She buys two large bunches and then goes back to find the cow in an alcove where it seems to spend the nights.  The cow is quite happy to munch away on the alfalfa and this kindly Canadian leaves the both bunches at her feet to be enjoyed at her own pace.

""Happy Birthday.  I honestly can't believe we're still married. "" 3 Ryan Reynolds, in turn, trolls the queenReynolds has own liquor company, Aviation Gin, and he didn't take it well when he learned that Buckingham Palace also has its own brand.  He did the only thing one could do in this situation: pre-order a bottle to have sent to Paul McCartney… at ""221B Baker Street, Downton Abbey Rd, 1D4 LYF. "" Too good.

"" 6 The Kardashians prank their famous friendsIn December, the Kardashian family played a trick on some of their friends—who happen to include celebs like Jennifer Lawrence and Justin Bieber—via FaceTime.  They got together, called their famous pals, and then just sat there, as if they had some kind of beef to share.  There were plenty of freakouts.  7 Jennifer Garner cannot deal with The Office finaleJennifer Garner and her kids watched The Office from start to finish while locked down this spring, and the actor filmed her heartbroken reaction to the series finale.  There was one problem, though: She accidentally recorded herself in slow motion.  Fortunately, she shared it with us anyway. ""Apparently we are sensitive people—the finale hit us pretty hard,"" Garner wrote.  ""When I realized I'd accidentally shot my farewell testimonial in slo-mo I realized: your Monday might need this, too.

""Yesterday I took out my top knot and a moth flew out of my hair and then I screamed and knocked over a glass of tequila and it shattered all over the floor and I spent about 2 hours cleaning up all the shards and was on my hands and knees with a headlamp looking for any missed pieces and ended up getting cuts on my hands and knees and then I decided it was time to finally shampoo,"" the comedian and actor said.  Who hasn't had a day like that? 9 Billy Eichner practicing his passive-aggressive faceComedian Billy Eichner took the opportunity to let his followers know exactly how he'll react when people begin showing off their antibody positive status while the rest of us suffer: Like this.  ""The face I'll make when you brag about your Covid antibodies,"" he captioned the selfie.  10 Taylor Swift captures her cat's flawless vibesTaylor Swift's cat Olivia Benson (named after the Law&Order: SVU character) is all of us, really—at least in this funny shot the artist shared in April.  ""Captain Olivia Benson off duty like…"" Swift wrote of her fur baby's pose.  11 John Mayer takes on that cringe-y ""Imagine"" singalongGal Gadot and a bevy of other celebs got quite a bit of backlash earlier this year for that video of them singing John Lennon's ""Imagine"" to somehow help(?) people cope with the COVID pandemic.  John Mayer brought a little levity to the situation when he shared his version of the project, where he said he'd misunderstood the assignment and accidentally sang Ariana Grande's song, ""Imagine,"" which is…not the same.  12 Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard argue over their AppleTV remoteThe struggle of losing remotes is an almost universal one, and it's more common for those that are super small, like the kind that come with AppleTV.  In this video, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard have a typical married couple argument about the remotes going missing, which may remind you of your last bickering session.  13 Stanley Tucci tends barThis just so happened to be the year that the world learned that Stanley Tucci is actually a killer bartender.  He started posting videos of himself making different drinks for him and his wife, Felicity Blunt, and injecting just the right amount of humor into his recipes.  In this one, he makes them classic Old Fashioneds, even though it's 11:30 in the morning.  14 Mindy Kaling does things the old fashioned way""When you fear you might be the only person left still writing checks,"" Mindy Kaling captioned this photo.  She's definitely not the last remaining check writer in the world, but it's getting close… 15 Nick Jonas reports on a conspiracyNick Jonas took to Instagram to explain the ""Jonas Blessing. "" He claims that athletes who come to see his band, the Jonas Brothers, end up bringing good luck back to their teams.  And he went all out to prove this one, including music, graphics, and sound effects.  16 John Legend's Election Day feelingsIn honor of Election Day in November, John Legend shared this photo of his son, Miles looking pensive but positive.  ""Mini-me cautiously/optimistically watching these election results come in,"" the singer wrote.  17 John Stamos' face shieldThis has been the year of face masks and shields, and fortunately, John Stamos approached the new normal with a sense of humor.  Along with this photo of Uncle Jesse demonstrating a hairspray shield on Full House, Stamos wrote, ""If ya'll would have just listened. "" 18 Joe Jonas's Star Wars transformationJoe Jonas is always on top of the new memes, but his most bizarrely funny post of the year is this one, in which he transforms from himself into… himself, wearing a Jar Jar Binks mask.  The ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" soundtrack is the finishing touch.  19 Matthew Koma shares his daughter's bedheadMatthew Koma and Hilary Duff's daughter Banks is too cute, even though her wild hair in this shot reminded her dad of a certain '00s pop star.  Along with sharing this photo of her hair sticking straight up, Koma told his followers to ""swipe for inspo,"" only for them to find a picture of ""On the Way Down"" singer Ryan Cabrera sporting the same style.  20 Andy Cohen's son worships Dolly PartonDolly Parton is basically an angel on this earth, and even though Andy Cohen's son, Benjamin, is still a toddler, he already gets it.  ""Is she God, daddy?"" Cohen captioned this shot of hid kid staring up at a painting of the philanthropic star.  21 Chelsea Handler sighting confirmedChelsea Handler shared this fan's account of running into her in a bar in Atlanta, which first appeared on the account OverheardCelebs, and having Handler let them know that their fly was down.  ""This sounds very familiar,"" the comedian captioned it, confirming that this actually did happen.  Embarrassing moment for the fan? Yes.  But definitely an unforgettable one, too.  22 Courteney Cox recreates an iconic Friends Thanksgiving momentIt's one of the most frequently referenced scenes on Friends: Courteney Cox's character, Monica, dancing with a turkey on her head to cheer Chandler up.  This Thanksgiving, the star reenacted the stunt for her followers with a real turkey, and she shared the disgusting-yet-funny behind-the-scenes footage of how she made it all happen.  23 Lizzo's topical Halloween costumeIt seems like eons ago now, but during the vice presidential debate this fall, a fly landed on Vice President Mike Pence's head and stayed there for quite awhile, launching several memes.  On Halloween, Lizzo dressed up as that newsworthy fly and even photoshopped herself into place.  24 Will Smith Lifts WeightsIn a video with Jason Derulo, Will Smith goes toe-to-toe with him while lifting weights.  They seem evenly matched until Smith's impressive torso is revealed to be green screen.  Hey, if you have access to Hollywood magic, why not use it? 25 Kylie Jenner tempts her daughter StormiEarlier this year, it was a popular social media trend for parents to leave their kids alone with a bowl of candy that they told them not to touch and then see what they did.  Kylie Jenner tried out the trend with daughter Stormi with some funny and sweet results.  26 Martha Stewart cooking to RhiannaMartha Stewart shared this video of her pounding chicken breasts for piccata recipe to the tune of Rihanna's 2016 hit ""Work. "" What, you didn't think this lifestyle queen had good taste in music? 27 Oprah's banana bread confrontationBanana bread became an even more popular treat during quarantine, and when Oprah Winfrey realized hers was gone, she knew exactly who to blame.  In this video, her longtime boyfriend, Stedman Graham, is confronted about the missing baked goods, only for him to reveal that he actually ate it all with absolutely zero shame.  28 Sara Foster's lets her social media team go""Quarantine has made my 'Instagram Team' lazy and incompetent,"" actor and model Sara Foster captioned this awkward photo.

"" Vivi and Josie would be her nine-year-old and five-year-old daughters, respectively.  29 Ariana Grande pays tribute to an Adam Sandler classicBack in April, Ariana Grande joined together with pals Elizabeth Gillies and Alfredo Flores to recreate a scene from The Waterboy, with Grande taking on Adam Sandler's iconic role.  ""And how'd u all make use of YOUR day?"" Grande wrote in her caption.  Well played.  30 Anne Hathaway became Mia Thermopolis againThe Princess Diaries is one of those movies that never gets old, as star Anne Hathaway knows very well.  Using pillows and some props around her house, Hathaway hilariously (and creatively) recreated her look from one of the movie's posters, captioning it with one of the movie's most quotable lines: ""A queen is never late; everyone else is simply early. "" 31 Ben Schwartz tries to relaxElection Week was a tense time for the entire country, and we all coped in different ways.  Comedian and actor Ben Schwartz took the opportunity to kick back and relax by…going to the dentist, because even that was a more chill experience than watching the results come in.  And yes, Parks and Recreation fans, someone did ask him if his dentist was Jeremy Jamm.  32 Brie Larson remembering the Met GalaLike most major evens this year, the 2020 Met Ball was canceled.  On what would have been the day of the high-fashion celebration, Brie Larson posed a throwback from when she accidentally ended up in what became an iconic bathroom selfie involving many of the celebs who were at the event. ""Seems like we're having a MetBall throwback moment today so I'd to take this time to remind everyone of the year I was trying to wash my hands in the bathroom and ended up in a Kardashian selfie,"" the Captain Marvel star wrote.  33 Italia Ricci being her own handymanDesignated Survivor actor Italia Ricci isn't afraid to do her own household repairs, as you can see in this post.   ""In loving memory of my manicure,"" she captioned it.  34 Rainn Wilson creates Dwight ExoticThanks to it dropping on Netflix around the time lockdowns started, Tiger King became a very hot and meme-able topic of conversation.  The Office star Rainn Wilson got in on the fun by sharing this terrifying and somehow conceivable mashup: Dwight Exotic.  35 Josh Gad is a ""maniac on the floor. ""I was never going to share this, but something tells me the world needs it now more than ever,"" Frozen star Josh Gad captioned this video of him dancing to the song ""Maniac"" in a flowing wig.  ""I hope it brings you peace. "" 36 Emily Ratajkowski's WFH flowIt may seem to some of us like we've been working from home forever, but back in the early days of the pandemic, there were still adjustments to be made.  Even the stars had to get used to it, and a lot of them took to lockdown orders by doing the same things the rest of us did: marathoning shows, eating junk, and spoiling our pets. ""Finished Love Is Blind (um, wow), ate two frozen pizzas w/ ranch, made calls from bed&took family selfies,"" model and writer Emily Ratajkowski captioned this family portrait.  ""Day one of working from home.  Also Colombo turns 1 next week how do we celebrate plz comment below. "" 37 Shaq wins the mask gameMasks are very much still a thing (and will be for a while), so you may as well get creative with yours and really make it your own.  Take NBA legend Shaq, for example.  Is there anything more personal than a face mask that's printed to look exactly like your face? 38 Isla Fisher meets her clones""All of them are better actors than me,"" Isla Fisher captioned this photo of herself surrounded by creepy mannequin heads.  Okay, that's definitely not true, but it's still pretty funny—and a little disconcerting.  What are they even for? 39 Kelly Ripa takes us on a hair journeyLockdown meant not being able to get regular beauty and grooming services, leaving many of us helpless to watch our haircuts grow out and roots come in, Kelly Ripa included.  The host didn't get too down about it.  Instead, she shared a 2020 hair timeline with her followers.  ""Perhaps this meme is a week old at this point… but does that really compare to these roots?"" she asked.  40 Gwyneth Paltrow FaceTimes with Robert Downey Jr. To encourage their followers to vote, Iron Man costars Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr.  got together to FaceTime about the election.  But that wasn't the only topic they addressed—the call didn't end until after Downey had ample opportunity to poke fun at his friend Paltrow and her expensive GOOP products.  41 Mariah Carey finds her lightMariah Carey took to Instagram in February to show her followers how good refrigerator lighting is for taking selfies, complete with background music and a little slow motion action to drive the point home.  Make sure to watch till the end so you can see her kids' reactions.  42 Kate Beckinsale has an audience for a private spa serviceWhen you're a star, you can afford getting your grooming services at home—but there is a downside.  Kate Beckinsale shared this photo from her perspective during a waxing appointment, showing her rapt audience. ""No kidding this bikini wax I just got drew a bigger audience than at least four movies I have done,"" the actor wrote.  ""Also my performance was described as 'shattering', 'visceral' and 'edge of the seat stuff'.  So I'm pleased. "" 43 Kumail Nanjiani shows off his proud dad's merchThere's no limit to what proud parents will do. Kumail Nanjiani just about broke the internet when he shared a photo of himself shirtless after all the training he did to star in Marvel's The Eternals.  Later, he was confronted by the image again while at his family home. ""Visiting the parents,"" Nanjiani wrote.  ""My dad has these socks. "" 44 Serena Williams gets a COVID test from a Disney princessThis year has been an interesting one for kids, including Serena Williams' daughter, Olympia.  Mom shared a video of her daughter playing the most 2020 game of make-believe: pretending to give her mom a COVID test—which she calls a ""coconut test""—while wearing a Snow White dress.  She counts to ten before removing it from her nose and everything.  Future doctor? 45 Angela Kinsey is a real cat ladyLike Angela Kinsey's character on The Office, Angela Martin, she's all about her cats.  In one of the most memorable scenes of the series, Angela tosses one of her furry friends through the Dunder Mifflin ceiling, and it seems that the actor's cats tend to get in some compromising positions, too.  Case in point: This photo of Kinsey's cat, Oreo, who has moved into a dollhouse. ""The cats are in rare form today,"" she wrote in the caption.  ""I have found Oreo in the hall closet, on top of the pantry shelf and now this…"" 46 Jenny Mollen gets creative with her Elf on a ShelfThanks to the popularity of Elf on a Shelf, plenty of parents spend a good chunk of the holiday season posing these ubiquitous figurines.  Jenny Mollen went the extra mile to make sure her kids with husband Jason Biggs, Sid and Lazlo, would be impressed.  Here we have the elves acting out the opening scene from Jaws—or as Mollen describes it, ""a children's holiday classic. "" 47 Sarah Michelle Gellar shows us where it all went wrongIt wasn't until July that Sarah Michelle Gellar realized that she had a bad omen about 2020 right at the beginning.  She said received this 2019 New Year's Eve hat instead of the 2020 she ordered at the end of last year.  ""Maybe someone was trying to tell us to not even attempt 2020,"" she wrote on Instagram.  ""Wish I had listened. "" 48 Gabrielle Union's daughter isn't having itGabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade's daughter Kaavia didn't seem too thankful this Thanksgiving.  In this video from their family dinner, someone—probably her dad—reaches out to clean up her face with a napkin, and she couldn't possibly be more annoyed.  Even better? The fact that her shirt very clearly proclaims that she's ""not interested. "" 49 Chrissy Teigen won't drop this jokeThe joke that John Legend looks almost exactly like the animated aardvark Arthur is one that's been around a while, but no, Chrissy Teigen shows no signs of letting it go yet.  Back in April, she shared this photo of their son, Miles, sitting with his stuffed animals, captioning it, ""Miles with daddy and Elmo. "" 50 Sebastian Stan pays tribute to Gossip GirlKnown more recently for his role of Bucky Barnes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sebastian Stan isn't one to forget his roots—roots like playing Carter Baizen in the teen drama Gossip Girl.  The actor marked the September anniversary of the show's premiere by sitting down to the pilot with a glass of wine and logging his visceral reactions for Twitter.  ""It was the best of times and it was the best of times,"" he captioned the video.  ""Xoxo, Gossip Girl.

Leptrone has Type 1 diabetes, and says Mona, who was trained by the Diabetic Alert Dogs of America to detect low blood sugar levels, saved her life one night when her blood sugar dropped to a dangerously low level.  Mona goes everywhere with Leptrone, and attended all of her classes and labs and other on-campus activities. At commencement, organizers gave Leptrone a small cap for Mona to wear during the event, but Leptrone told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution she had no idea the university was going to recognize Mona until they awarded her an honorary dog-ree: her very own Bark-chelor of Science in Nursing. Leptrone, who has accepted a job as an intensive care unit nurse in Douglasville, Georgia, told the Journal-Constitution she thought it was wonderful that her school included Mona during the graduation festivities.  ""I'm just hoping that it shows other people like me who have a service dog that they can still obtain a high level of education and do what they've always dreamed of doing with their lives,"" she said.

Soon they'll be too big to fit through the obstacles, and a new batch of piglets will replace them.  Pig races are especially popular in China right now as people celebrate the Year of the Pig.  A normal race is just one lap long, and the piglets get a 10-minute break once they cross the finish line.  And they aren't the only animals with a need for speed. #https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/story/baby-pigs-race-against-each-other-in-china/vi-BB1bZL8n#FClR2mFqM

Finding a leopard mother and her cub in the wild is a priceless, once in a lifetime, experience.  I recently had the rare opportunity to film the adorable moments of a playful leopard cub, totally amused by its mother’s tail.  The leopard is one of the most elusive animals in the African bush.  This shy and solitary big cat is part of the so called Big five animals in Africa that also includes lion, buffalo, rhino and elephant.  The leopard is by far the most difficult to find and see.  The leopard relies on its camouflage and stealth to bring down prey that can range from mice to large antelope species.  It was during a recent safari in the Kruger National Park that we were lucky enough to come across a female leopard, lying alone in the sand of a dry riverbed.  We were absolutely ecstatic with our find.  We all whipped out our cameras and started filming and taking pictures.  It was not long before we were absolutely exhilarated by the fact that the female leopard had the most adorable cub.  Out of nowhere, the cute leopard cub appeared.  The appearance of the cub took us all by surprise and we couldn’t believe that we were actually sitting with two leopards in front of us.  Leopards are solitary predators and do not like to be seen.  If you are lucky enough to find a leopard in the wild, it will always be alone.  Only under rare circumstances will you get to see more than one leopard together such as this one with the mother and her cub and when a male and female meet up to mate.  The moments that followed between this leopard cub and its mother was filled with playfulness and motherly love.  When the leopard cub appeared from the bush, it was immediately interested in its mother’s tail.  It was so cute to watch how the cub’s hunting instincts was triggered by its mother’s moving tail.  Every time the female leopard would move her tail, the cub would playfully paw at her tail while trying to grab it.  This playful behaviour continued for a while until the cub became bored with its mother’s tail.  The leopard cub decided it was time to snuggle up against its mother before falling asleep.  We decided that we would not overstay our welcome and left the two leopards in peace. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cute-leopard-cub-loves-play-220012879.html#5lqBORhDj

Kathy Nuttle, who moved to Alaska with her family from New York eight years ago, was preparing a meal for a small gathering when she spotted the moose with her three babies on November 30.  The chances of multiple births, usually twins, increases when a moose cow is well-nourished and safe during pregnancy.  Triplets, however, are an extremely rare sighting.  Speaking about the video Kathy said: ""We looked out our kitchen window to see a moose mother with three babies - probably born May 2020.  ""Triplets are very rare, so I gathered my camera and went out to our back deck and took the video and several pictures.  ""We have moose in our yard often, but not a mother with three babies.

Between a pandemic, the ensuing economic depression and a little thing called Brexit looming over our heads, it's going to be tough to get into the merrymaking mood. But that's not to say you shouldn't give it a jolly good go.  After all, there's plenty to be cheerful about: a vaccine has started to roll out, Trump has been served his marching orders and, well, it's Christmas! Time to eat, drink and be merry.  It's what Prime Minister Hugh Grant would want (right after an inappropriately timed kiss from Martine McCutcheon, of course). One way to get yourself in the Christmas spirit is to fake it 'til you make it.  By which we mean making your house look as Christmassy as possible until the magic of the season begins to warm your cold, cold heart.  Tablescaping is an excellent way to do this.  Not only will a dreamy-looking table fill your support bubble with anticipation from the moment they step into the kitchen but a nice set of napkins and ornaments will go a long way to cover up the fact that you burned the turkey. So click through to find some super simple ideas to get your table looking Christmassy ahead of the big day.  Hopefully your Christmas cheer will follow.

The mission, to boldly go where no probe has gone before, will track and travel to an as-yet unidentified comet and map it in 3D for the first time.  Once in space the craft will lie in wait, potentially for years, until a cosmic candidate is spotted by astronomers on Earth.  From there it will set out to intercept it, deploying two smaller probes which will take readings and beam the data back to the main hub.  Though the process could only take a few hours, it is thought to shed light on the conditions in our universe more than four billion years ago.  The Telegraph understands that numerous countries applied to run the project and it is viewed by officials as a major coup for the UK scientific community.  Thales Alenia Space, a company with three sites in the UK and nearly 200 employees won the contract to design the mothership for the Comet Interceptor mission, with the two smaller probes made in Japan.  It is the first of the European Space Agency’s new class of “fast” missions where light equipment can hitchhike into space on an already scheduled launch.  This mission was originally proposed by a team led by UK academics from University College London and the University of Edinburgh.  Amanda Solloway, the science minister said: “The UK’s space industry is thriving and this out-of-this-world mission is testament to our world-leading expertise.  “I am very proud that scientists and engineers in Bristol and Harwell will be designing the Comet Interceptor spacecraft – their incredible work will not only further our understanding of the evolution of comets but help unlock the mysteries of the universe. ” Scientists are likely to target a comet from the Oort Cloud, a band of icy debris which lies between the sun and our next nearest star.  This cloud contains matter formed during the birth of our solar system, which will have been left intact as it has not been vaporised by rays from the sun.  This means that the probes will be able to study the composition of the comet to evaluate whether similar specimens may have brought water to Earth in the past.  Life on our planet could not exist without water, and it is thought by many that comets may have been responsible for bringing that water to our planet.  Andrew Stanniland, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK said: “I am delighted ESA has once again placed its trust in our scientists and engineers at Thales Alenia Space in the UK who have excellent heritage from previous scientific missions such as Giotto and Rosetta.  “We all look forward to supporting this exciting and unprecedented scientific mission to uncover more information about the origins of our Universe. ”#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/britain-build-comet-chaser-spacecraft-184736082.html#qwAjDsZPT

Gunner, a four-month-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel, was rescued from an alligator attack in October when his owner Richard Wilbanks jumped into a pond to save him. Video of the incident shows Wilbanks pulling an alligator’s jaws apart, freeing Gunner. Gunner was this week officially deputized as a member of the Lee County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Dogs program. “Do you swear to uphold the constitutional law for the Lee County Sheriff’s Office? This is a big day, OK.  You are going to be a detective now,” Sheriff Carmine Marceno said to Gunner while pinning a badge on his harness. The Deputy Dogs Pets on Patrol initiative “encourages pet owners to pay closer attention to suspicious activity while out with their pets and report concerns to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office,” the sheriff’s office says.

Seeing baby animals in the African wild is always a special occasion.  It was during a safari in the Kruger National Park that this adorable moment between a lion cub and his father was captured.  It was like watching a possible real-life scene from the Lion King movie with Simba jumping on top of Mufasa, looking for attention.  We recently had incredible luck on our side during a safari when we came across a large pride of lions resting in the shade.  Lions are big sleepers and they can easily spend twenty hours of the day just sleeping, resting and doing absolutely nothing.  Part of the pride were three adorable cubs, clearly not looking to go to rest any time soon.  While the adults were sleeping, the cute lion cubs had other plans of their own.  I remembered as a child the trouble I got into for making a noise while my parents were trying to take their afternoon nap.  One male lion cub, who clearly had all the courage in the world or couldn’t care less, decided it was time to go and seek some attention from his father, a big male lion sleeping a short distance away from the rest of the pride.  The lion cub carefully approached the King of the Jungle, making us wonder how this whole ordeal was going to turn out.  What happened next totally amazed us.  The lion cub unexpectedly decided to climb on top of his father, curiously investigating his impressive mane.  Still there was not a single response coming from the big male lion.  The lion cub sat on top his father, looking very comfortable, thinking of what else he can do to get his father’s attention.  The cub decided to get down from his father and thought that cuddling with his father would do the trick.  Even after placing his paw on his father’s face, licking him a few times again after, the lion cub realized that he was not going to receive any sort of attention.  The cub turned around and started planning his next move while checking to see what was happening with the rest of the pride members.  At that very moment the big lazy male lion slowly turned onto his back and continued snoozing with his feet up in the air, acting as if nothing happened.  The cub was already so fixated on his new mission that he totally ignored his father and went back to play with the other two cubs.  Even though the male lion did not show any sort of response while his son looked for attention, we were amazed by the unconditional patience and acceptance the male lion showed towards his son.  With a paw the size of the cub’s head, the father could easily have sent his son flying in annoyance which has happened before.  In our opinion this was a sign of true fatherly love as we all knew the big male lion wasn’t really fast asleep all that time and he was well aware of what was going on the whole time. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lion-cub-adamantly-seeks-attention-220011355.html#9hsrOxinb

Theo, a one-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel, was clearly taken by surprise when encountering such an object for the first time as his owner, Haley Sutermeister, filmed the stand-off before posting the footage on Instagram. “This was his first encounter with a giant inflatable decoration, and he was certain he was protecting his mom and his brother, Joey, by growling at the decoration,” Sutermeister told Storyful.

Between throwing a literal tantrum every Sunday morning when my dad would forcefully pry me out of bed so that I wouldn’t be late for Hebrew school, and then never returning the temple again after I had a raging Bat Mitzvah, well. . .  I guess you could say my devotion to Judaism is pretty pathetic at best.  Do I fast on Yom Kippur? Of course not—the thought of giving up my morning cup of coffee because I’m “repenting” is simply out of the question.  However, just because you might not find me at the synagogue on a weekly or evenly quarterly basis doesn’t mean that I don’t love being Jewish.

Marni Licursi recorded a video that showed a toy Santa ascending a toy ski lift and then sliding down the ski track around her Christmas tree.  The video clocked more than 750,000 views on TiKTok. Licursi told Storyful that the toy was called Mr Christmas Santa’s Ski Slope, which was purchased by her neighbor in 1992.  She stored the toy in her basement for a few years after her neighbor threw it out, she said.
