Biden will also reportedly appoint experienced diplomat Timothy Lenderking as special envoy to Yemen.  It remains to be seen exactly how this will play out, but as Sen.  Bernie Sanders (I-Vt. ) noted in a statement, it looks like the start of a diplomatic push to get Saudi Arabia to end the brutal war in which it has been bogged down since 2015, obtain a general ceasefire, and coordinate an international aid effort.  The Saudi military basically cannot do anything without U. S.  support, and any strong signals from America that it should knock it off probably will be heeded.  That's especially true now that Trump is gone, and Saudi dictator Mohammad bin Salman thus faces possible recrimination for ordering the cold-blooded murder of a U. S.  resident and Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, back in 2018.  It is worth noting that while Biden is reversing a Trump decision, the Yemen policy actually originated under the Obama administration.  It is a marked difference from the early months of 2009, when Obama kept on George W.  Bush's secretary of defense and planned for a massive troop surge in Afghanistan.  Perhaps two decades of expensive, bloody, and totally unsuccessful wars are enough? More stories from theweek. comGOP Sen.

This week actually brings us two giveaways, one we knew about—For the King, which Epic revealed last week—and another that, as far as I know, is a surprise bonus. For the King is a strategy roguelike about misfit adventurers who strike out to right the wrongs that have befallen their kingdom.  ""It's a goofy dungeon romp personified, with the kind of playful character that has become so popular in Dungeons & Dragons actual play podcasts,"" we said in our 75% review, but also ""often a difficult, ruthless game"" that will not hesitate to kill you.  Your party of three heroes can be controlled by a solo players, but it's really best enjoyed as a co-op experience. The second game going out free this week is Metro: Last Light Redux, the grimy, end-of-the-world FPS set in (and, occasionally, above) the tunnels of the Moscow Metro.  Last Light is more forgiving than its predecessor, Metro 2033, and the Redux release includes a range of new modes and features, gameplay improvements, and all DLC.  And bar none, it's one of the best post-apoc shooters you can get your hands on.  For the King and Metro: Last Light Redux are free until February 11.  After that comes Halcyon 6: Lightspeed Edition, a ""massively enhanced version"" of the 2016 sci-fi base-building strategy RPG.  For even more free games, don't miss our lists of best free PC games, best free games on Steam, best browser games, and all the free games you can grab right now.

At some point in time, a football game became the only annual event that transcends race, religion, gender, or creed in this country, as “Super Bowl Sunday” is the one thing we almost all do.  But on Thursday, it was less about the topics that were discussed at the press conference, and more about a very important one that wasn’t even acknowledged: violence against women. #https://deadspin.com/it-s-pathetic-that-chad-wheeler-s-name-wasn-t-mentioned-1846200661#zcXtD7XL8

2021-02-04 15:34:43#business#American Airlines Planning To Furlough Up To 13,000 Employees - Report#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-planning-furlough-13-153443771.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S0pevIl76_xwDFTuFOCDCw--~B/aD02MTc7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smarteranalyst_347/21b55fa43b022765217e0ce8456802e7#en#0.0#finance.yahoo.com#American Airlines confirmed on Wednesday that 13,000 of its employees were at risk of furlough as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the aviation industry, according to Reuters.  A U. S.  aid package for airline workers expires on April 1, and American Airlines (AAL) finds itself “in a situation similar to much of 2020,” said CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom in a memo to employees, which was also included in a regulatory filing.  “The vaccine is not being distributed as quickly as any of us believed, and new restrictions on international travel that require customers to have a negative COVID-19 test have dampened demand,” Parker and Isom added.  Reuters reports that American Airlines will offer their employees, including 1,850 pilots and 4,245 flight attendants, voluntary exit packages in the hope that it will ease the possibility of involuntary retrenchments.  American Airlines reported its financial results for 2020 last week, posting a full-year net loss of around $9 billion.  In an attempt to boost liquidity, the airline company took advantage of the sharp rise in its share price due to the WallStreetBets inspired short squeeze and launched a $1 billion stock sale.  (See American Airlines stock analysis on TipRanks) Seaport Global analyst Daniel Mckenzie downgraded American Airlines three days ago from Buy to Hold and withdrew his price target.  “Our conviction in the recovery story doesn’t change, but given limited upside to our $19 target price, risk reward is balanced given COVID variants that slow the int’l revenue recovery and cause us to trim our pre-tax earnings outlook.  Hence our move to the sidelines today; downgrading to Neutral (from Buy) and withdrawing our target price,” Mckenzie explained.  Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Sell based on 1 Buy, 5 Holds and 7 Sells.  The average analyst price target of $14. 14 suggests downside potential of 20% over the next 12 months.  Hedge Fund Activity for AAL decreased substantially over the last quarter, with a significant reduction in holdings and a Very Negative Confidence Signal.

The Tool and Puscifer singer told Apple Music Hits’ George Stroumboulopoulos that he ended up in hospital in December 2020 after his second bout of the virus. “I don’t know if I said anything online, but I had it twice,” said Keenan of his experience.  “Ugly, ugly.  Couldn’t breathe.  I could barely put two words together without going into a coughing fit that, you know? It ended up kind of also progressing into pneumonia.  So, if I stayed in the hospital, they said, ‘Okay, we can keep you here, but you’re fighting 12 other people for a bed and a ventilator we don’t have, so what do you want to do?’ I’m like, ‘Well, I need to breathe and I need to sleep. ’”Keenan told Stroumboulopoulos that he decided to treat his symptoms at home. “There’s nothing you can do other than treat the symptom, so for a real cough medicine, not the crap over-the-counter and then like an inhaler, and some antibiotics to fight the pneumonia and strap the fuck in. ”Keenan has previously said that he initially contracted Covid in early 2020.  In October, he revealed that he was still dealing with the effects of the virus. “I survived it, but it wasn’t pretty,” he told AZ Central.  “I had to go through some major medications to undo the residual effects.  Still coughing.  There’s still lung damage. ”In another interview with The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Keenan poured scorn on Covid deniers and conspiracy theorists. “Maybe I didn’t almost die, but I have friends who almost died.  It was ugly.  And then you have people going… apparently I’m being paid to say this.  Eat a dick, dude. ”#https://www.loudersound.com/news/tools-maynard-james-keenan-ive-had-covid-twice#s8MJsd8Ez
