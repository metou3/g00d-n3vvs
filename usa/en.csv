2021-02-22 20:13:23#tech#When Android 12 is coming to your phone#https://phandroid.com/2021/02/22/when-android-12-is-coming-to-your-phone/#https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android-12-pixel-5-8-640x427.jpg#en#0.0#phandroid.com#There are quite a lot of new features that are hidden away in Android 12, which is what we have come to expect.  Google has just released the first developer preview, and there are some changes enabled by default, and others that aren’t as obvious.  What’s new in Android 12 As is the case with every major version of Android, Pixel devices get the first crack at the latest features.  Then, phone makers will start to release beta versions of their own (in certain areas), before releasing the final updates.  But that still leads to the question of ‘When is my phone getting Android 12?’ Android 12 Release Schedule Last week marked the first release of the Android 12 developer preview, meaning that we are still a few months away from any official beta release.  According to the official release schedule that was provided, the first Android 12 beta could launch as early as May.  Expect to see the first Android 12 beta launch in May This would get Android 12 into the hands of more users, allowing for bugs to be fixed and features to either be added or removed.  There will be a total of four betas released ahead of the final version.  If Android 11 was any indication, then we could see the final version of Android 12 released in early September.  Google Pixel As is the case with every release of Android, Google Pixel owners will receive Android 12 the day that it’s released.  Barring any setbacks, we are expecting to see the first beta for Pixel owners arrive sometime in May.  Then, the final release is slated for sometime later this year, and according to the schedule provided by Google, Android 12 should arrive for everyone in September.  These are the Pixel devices we are expecting to see receive Android 12: Pixel 3 / 3XL Pixel 3a / 3a XL Pixel 4 / 4 XL Pixel 4a / 4a 5G Pixel 5 Android 12 marks the end of support for the good ole’ Pixel 2 and 2 XL, which was expected considering Google’s previous three-year commitment for device updates.  Samsung For years, Samsung was one of the most egregious offenders when it came to providing timely software updates.  However, over the last year or so, Samsung has changed its tune.  This was evidenced by the “mad dash” to push the Android 11 update (via One UI 3. 0), before updating many of its handsets to One UI 3. 5.  The company has even just announced that it will be providing up to four years of security updates for smartphones, starting with the Galaxy S10 line that was released in 2019.  As for Android 12, there’s no real way to tell when the update will officially arrive for your smartphone.  We do know that almost any phone released starting in 2019 will receive the update.  Alongside the launch of the Galaxy Note 20, Samsung confirmed that it will be sticking to three years of major Android releases for devices.  Based on the schedule for the Android 11 update, we can expect to see devices starting to receive the update at the end of 2021, and into the beginning of 2022.  These are the devices we are expecting to see receive Android 12: Galaxy S21 / S21+ / S21 Ultra Galaxy S20 / S20+ / S20 Ultra / S20 FE Galaxy Note 20 / Note 20 Ultra Galaxy S10 / S10e / S10 Lite / S10 Plus Galaxy Note 10 / Note 10+ / Note 10 Lite Galaxy Z Flip / Z Flip 5G Galaxy Z Fold 2 Galaxy A71 Galaxy A51 Galaxy A90 5G Galaxy Tab S7 / S7+ Galaxy Tab S6 / S6 Lite OnePlus Ignoring OnePlus’ budget lineup for a moment, the company has a pretty solid track record for releasing stable versions of new Android releases.  For example, Android 11 was released for Pixel owners on September 8th, and it arrived on the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro on October 10th.  Although older devices, like the OnePlus 7 and 7T have seen mixed results due to buggy beta versions, we can expect a quick turnaround from OnePlus for its newer handsets.  It’s also important to note that the Android 12 release could spell the end of official support for the OnePlus 6 and 6T.  These are the OnePlus devices we are expecting to see receive Android 12: OnePlus 7 / 7T / 7T Pro OnePlus 8 / 8 Pro / 8T OnePlus Nord Motorola A company that was once at the top of the list with software updates, has slowly turned into one of the more frustrating companies.  Motorola launched the new Moto One 5G Ace, G Stylus, and G Power earlier this year, but all three handsets shipped with Android 10.  In fact, when the company shared its plans for updating devices to Android 11, it stated that many of those devices would not receive the update to Android 12.  Motorola has yet to share a roadmap of when it expects to release the Android 12 update for recently-launched products.  However, it did confirm that both the Edge+ and Moto RAZR would be receiving the update.  So it’s just a waiting game until we find out a more concrete answer on the update schedule.  LG When 2021 is all said and done, we wouldn’t be surprised if LG makes its official exit out of the smartphone game.  It’s been rumored and suggested that this would be the plan at some point, even after showing off the LG Rollable at CES 2021.  Following that up, a recent report claims that LG has reached out to its manufacturing partners for the Rollable, requesting to pause production.  LG has fallen quite hard, as it was once a provider of a great smartphone experience.  But it seems that the battle to keep up with the Samsung’s and Apple’s of the world has taken its toll.  The company has not given any indication as to when and/or if its recently-released smartphones will get an update to Android 12.  In the event that LG sticks around, these are the devices would expect to see updated to Android 12: LG V60 ThinQ LG Wing LG Velvet Oppo When a new version of Android is introduced, company's begin their internal testing, similar to what we see Google do ahead of the final launch.  Oppo is one of those companies that has been not only performing internal testing, but also opens up a beta program for new versions of Color OS.  With Android 12, we're expecting to see a similar schedule to what we have seen with the Android 11 release cycle.  Development will begin around now, with a beta program to launch shortly after the final version of Android 12 is released.  This will be available for select devices (usually the higher-end models), before trickling down to more options from Oppo's lineup.  We wouldn't be surprised to see the first beta of Color OS (12?) released in September, ahead of the final version rolling out in October, November, and/or December of this year.  Xiaomi Xiaomi is still in the process of updating its vast array of devices to Android 11 (courtesy of MIUI 12), and there's a laundry list of smartphones left to go.  However, that doesn't necessarily mean that Android 12 will be avoided altogether, as we're sure the company is getting a head-start on the development process.  Whenever the next version of MIUI is announced, it will likely either be MIUI 12. 5 or MIUI 13, and will be based on Android 12.  The real question is when this will roll out to devices, but if we were guessing, Android 12 wouldn't be arriving until sometime in early 2022.  Vivo One company that has a lot of pull in other areas of the world, but doesn't have the greatest track record when it comes to updates is Vivo.  The company has shown that it's willing to push the envelope when it comes to hardware development, but the software side is another story.  Thankfully, it seems that Vivo is changing its tune a bit when it comes to its newer devices like the iQOO 3 5G.  Vivo has confirmed that the iQOO 3 will receive two major Android updates, including Android 12, along with security updates for a total of three years.  Huawei Thanks to the trade ban in the U. S. , Huawei's hand was forced when it came to developing its own software for its devices.  The company has pivoted to HarmonyOS, which has been in development for a few years now.  However, until the trade ban, there were no immediate plans to switch the operating systems from Google's Android.  With that being said, starting in April of this year, Huawei devices will be released with HarmonyOS in-tow.  This means that future smartphones will not be powered by Android 12, and unless something changes between Huawei and the U. S. , HarmonyOS will be the way of the future for Huawei. #https://phandroid.com/2021/02/22/when-android-12-is-coming-to-your-phone/#mnhpMnQMG

This could see the machines fail in less than two years, if the numbers are correct, and while this really is a worst-case scenario, it still paints a worrying picture about the longevity of the new machines.  Something compounded by the fact that the SSDs are soldered on the mainboards, which means replacing them isn't straightforward. Core to what's going on is the way in which SSDs work, specifically the number of writes they can reliably support.  The flash memory on the drives can only be written to a certain number of times before becoming unstable.  There are plenty of systems in place to spread the load across all the memory cells, but essentially there's a point where the drive has been written to so many times that it can no longer reliably hold the information. This is all summed up by the Total Bytes Written figure, measured in terabytes (which is why it's also referred to as Terabytes Written).  This needs to be considered in the context of the length of the warranty, which is generally five years. #https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-m1-macs-appear-to-be-chewing-through-their-ssds/#noV94HdfR

The Philippines, among the fastest growing economies in Asia before the pandemic, saw its gross domestic product slump by a record 9. 5% in 2020, as one of the world's longest and strictest COVID-19 lockdowns shuttered thousands of businesses and left millions out of work.  The restrictions in Manila, the epicentre of the Philippine epidemic, were set to end this month but will be extended until the mass vaccination drive is underway. #https://news.yahoo.com/philippine-leader-maintain-capitals-coronavirus-114904263.html#LcWMzbrGL

New SMB, Mid-Market and Enterprise customers were added at an estimated LTV to CAC ratio of 4. 9:1, up from 4. 4:1 in 2019 Business Highlights Product Highlights: The Company continues to invest in building the best open SaaS ecommerce platform in the world, supported and integrated with the Company’s extensive network of best-of-breed technology and agency partners.  Fourth quarter highlights include:-- The Company further optimized the product for international markets by adding support for German, Dutch, Portuguese, and Swedish to its merchant admin panel and a native integration to global payments partner, Checkout. com. -- It bolstered its Open SaaS strategy by introducing Storefront API powered by GraphQL, which is optimized for headless implementations including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), native mobile experiences and Content Management Systems (CMSs). -- The Company completed the rollout of Channel Manager in October, a unified hub to help merchants streamline listing and selling products on third-party sales channels via seamless integrations with Amazon, eBay, Wish, Google, and Facebook/Instagram to help amplify merchant reach to millions of shoppers.  In parallel, the Company launched Channels Toolkit, -- a toolset composed of APIs, resources, and tools -- that enables partners and developers to deeply integrate third-party channels.

Fourth Quarter Financials: Other Key Business Metrics Number of accounts greater than $2,000 in annual contract value (ACV) was 10,184, up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Average revenue per account (ARPA) of accounts greater than $2,000 in ACV was $14,615, up 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.  Operating Income/(Loss) GAAP operating loss was ($13. 8) million, compared to ($9. 8) million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP operating loss was ($7. 6) million, compared to ($8. 8) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Net Income/(Loss) and Earnings Per Share GAAP net loss was ($14. 2) million, compared to ($10. 3) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Non-GAAP net loss was ($8. 0) million or (18%) of total revenue, compared to ($9. 4) million or (30%) of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The nearly 12 point improvement in non-GAAP net loss as a percent of revenue was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving further leverage in the business as the Company continues to scale. GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 21) based on 68. 6 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($0. 68) based on 18. 0 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 12) based on 68. 6 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($0. 52) based on 18. 0 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was negative ($6. 8) million, compared to ($8. 1) million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively and drive operating leverage in R&D and sales and marketing spending.  Fiscal Year 2020 Financials: Total revenue was $152. 4 million, up 36% compared to fiscal year 2019.  Operating Income/(Loss) GAAP operating loss was ($38. 7) million, compared to ($41. 0) million in fiscal year 2019. Non-GAAP operating loss was ($27. 4) million, compared to ($37. 8) million in fiscal year 2019.  Net Income/(Loss) and Earnings Per Share GAAP net loss was ($37. 6) million, compared to ($42. 6) million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss was ($30. 7) million or (20%) of total revenue, compared to ($39. 4) million or (35%) of total revenue in fiscal year 2019.  The nearly 15 point improvement in non-GAAP net loss as a percent of revenue was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving further leverage in the business as the Company continues to scale. GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 99) based on 39. 1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($2. 80) based on 17. 8 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal year 2019. Non-GAAP net loss per share was ($0. 79) based on 39. 1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, compared to ($2. 21) based on 17. 8 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal year 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was ($24. 5) million, compared to ($35. 5) million in fiscal year 2019.  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of the significant increase in high margin PSR and the Company’s ability to manage spend effectively while driving operating leverage in R&D and sales and marketing spending.  This increase was partially offset by higher costs in G&A primarily due to public company expenses.  Cash Cash and cash equivalents totaled $219. 4 million as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was ($26. 5) million, compared to ($40. 0) million for the same period in 2019. Free cash flow was ($28. 5) million, compared to ($45. 5) million for the same period in 2019.  Q1 and 2021 Financial OutlookFor the first quarter of 2021, the Company currently expects: Total revenue between $41. 8 million and $42. 3 million. Non-GAAP operating loss between ($8. 2) million and ($7. 9) million.  For the full year 2021, the Company currently expects: Total revenue between $189. 0 million and $191. 0 million. Non-GAAP operating loss between ($34. 5) million and ($33. 3) million.  The Company’s first quarter and 2021 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the Company’s control.  If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change.  There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.  The Company does not provide guidance for operating loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating loss, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share and these comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items.  These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.

Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.  Annual revenue run-rate We calculate annual revenue run-rate (“ARR”) at the end of each month as the sum of: (1) the product of the current month’s monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) multiplied by twelve (to prospectively annualize subscription revenue), and (2) the trailing twelve-month partner and services revenue, including non-recurring services revenue, such as one-time partner integration fees and store-launch services.  MRR includes BigCommerce platform subscription fees and invoiced growth adjustments as customers’ businesses grow past contracted order thresholds after a threshold has been met.  It also includes recurring professional services revenue, such as recurring technical account management services and product training services.  Accounts with greater than $2,000 ACV We track the total number of accounts with annual contract value (“ACV”) greater than $2,000 (the “ACV threshold”) as of the end of a monthly billing period.  To define this $2,000 ACV cohort, we include only subscription plan revenue and exclude partner and services revenue and recurring services revenue.  We consider all stores added and subtracted as of the end of the monthly billing period.  This metric includes accounts that may have either one single store above the ACV threshold or multiple stores that together exceed the ACV threshold.  Accordingly, this cohort would include: (1) customers on Enterprise plans, (2) customers on Pro plans, and (3) customers with multiple plans that together exceed the ACV threshold.  Average revenue per account We calculate average revenue per account (ARPA) for accounts above the ACV threshold at the end of a period by including customer-billed revenue and an allocation of partner and services revenue.  Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, changes in fair value of financial instruments, and our provision for income taxes.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.  Non-GAAP Operating Loss We define Non-GAAP Operating Loss as our GAAP Loss from operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our loss from operations.  Non-GAAP Net Loss We define Non-GAAP Net Loss as our GAAP net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our net loss.  Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share We define Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share as our Non-GAAP Net Loss, defined above, divided by our basic and diluted GAAP weighted average shares outstanding.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our net loss per share.  Free Cash Flow We define Free Cash flow as our GAAP cash flow from operating activities plus our GAAP purchases of property and equipment (Capital Expenditures).  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our cash flow from operating activities.

This week we posed the following question to 1,000 Benzinga readers on the 2021 price action of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE).  Over the next year, which cryptocurrency will have the largest percentage gain? Bitcoin 37% Ethereum 32% Dogecoin 31% As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been hitting new highs in recent months.  Bitcoin trades around $53,000 at time of publication, off the all-time high of $58,300.  See Also: Is Bitcoin A Good Investment? Experts in crypto like Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, believe the price of Bitcoin is going to reach 0,000 by the end of the year.  Ethereum expands upon Bitcoin’s infrastructure in terms of useability.  Instead of only transferring coins between wallets, Ethereum’s network supports the creation of decentralized applications, or DApps, that allow users to execute agreements with one another without the use of a middleman.  Ethereum trades around $1,750 at publication time, off the all-time high of $2,036.  Meanwhile, Dogecoin is built on the same basic technology as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  The Shiba-Inu based cryptocurrency was introduced as a joke in 2013 to help raise public awareness of the capabilities of blockchain technology.  Now, Dogecoin is catching on with celebrities from Elon Musk to Gene Simmons.  Dogecoin trades around 5 cents and has an all-time high of $0. 087.

Yet the cards have been spotted in online stores all across the map early, and it wouldn't be surprising to hear people are rushing to snatch them up. According to VideoCardz, a seller named Artem had three Gigabyte Eagle RTX 3060 cards on sale in Belarusian store Onliner over the weekend.  The sale page has since disappeared, now throwing up a 404, but I'd bet these cards sold for their listing price of $1,080 each (in USD equivalent cash).  That is, if they weren't pulled beforehand. What's really funny about this listing is that these sale images clearly show the serial numbers.  That makes it a doddle for Gigabyte to trace the cards and find out exactly where they slipped off the truck.  Perhaps it's only a matter of time before someone gets the sack. #https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-reseller-1000-dollars/#ge30hWtB5

Today it dropped a trailer showcasing the new mode in action, along with a blog post detailing how it's all going to work. The trailer isn't much to write home about, I don't think: Gunfire, explosions, zombies, and generic one-liners delivered flatly by voice actors who sound like they're reading from the phone book, while a classic rock remix plays in the background.  The blog post is a different story, however.  There's plenty of narrative background if you're into that sort of thing, and more practically there's also a breakdown of how the new mode will actually play. Squads of up to four players will be inserted into the Outbreak zone and given one of five objectives to investigate and complete.  How you approach these objectives is entirely up to you: You can take any route to get there, and as much time as you like along the way.  Exploring the region will uncover rewards in loot chests, trigger random encounters, and open up Trial Computers. More types of missions are expected to be added as Outbreak grows and evolves, but for now, this is what you'll be getting up to:"#https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-details-how-call-of-duty-cold-wars-zombies-outbreak-mode-will-actually-work/#ewwo6OIuk

Along with those three, other stars of Season 2 include Gbenga Akinnagbe (“The Deuce”), Susan Blackwell (“Madam Secretary”), Lucy Boynton (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), Tom Burke (“Mank”), Zoe Chao (“Love Life”), Maria Dizzia (“Orange is the New Black”), Grace Edwards, Dominique Fishback (“Judas and the Black Messiah”), Kathryn Gallagher (“Jagged Little Pill”), Garrett Hedlund (“Mudbound”), Telci Huynh (“God Friended Me”), Nikki M.

Despite the warning, “the coordination and planning by authorities across the broader energy sector were seemingly disproportionate to the severity of the situation,” Vistra said in an emailed statement late Sunday.  The company didn’t identify which state entities it contacted.  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas is the state’s grid operator, while the Texas Public Utility Commission regulates power generators. Ercot said in a statement its “operating notices incentived all available generation to serve customers” and didn’t immediately comment on the Vistra letter.  Andrew Barlow, an official with the PUC, said he wasn’t privy to any correspondence between the agency and Vistra and referred the matter to Ercot. “Days ahead of this event, Vistra and others forecasted insufficient generation would be available, and we began winter emergency preparations,” the statement said.  “The warning signs were there, but the public was unaware of the gravity of the situation, which led to people being unable to respond and make the necessary adjustments for their families. ”Read more: How Extreme Cold Turned Into a U.
