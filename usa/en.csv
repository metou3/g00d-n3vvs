The stock, which recently ended development of an experimental therapy for Covid-19, rallied to close 39% higher on Monday after a poster on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum called it “the most undervalued stock in the market” while another said a brewing BioWar was “about sticking it to the shorts in a massive way. ”​Biotechs with little to no revenue have long been the focus of short bets on Wall Street and could emerge as a new focal point for small-time investors railing against elite hedge funds.  But the battleground is an already crowded arena with hedge funds positioned on both sides. Indeed, BioCryst is a short target with about 17% of float, or $259 million, sold short, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.  But it’s also a hedge fund pick held by the likes of Citadel, the well-known biotech outfit Baker Bros.  Advisors LP, and activist investor Alex Denner’s Sarissa Capital Management. Before Monday’s rally, shares of BioCryst had already shrugged off the scuttling of a Covid-19 trial supported by the National Institutes of Health.  The company is expected to generate less than $31 million in revenue for all of 2020. Novavax Inc. , another heavily-shorted biotech, has also garnered interest across chat forums, which could benefit funds like RA Capital Management and Perceptive Advisors, which hold stakes in the company.  The stock has more than doubled in the past few trading days, albeit on late-stage positive results for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.  The short position on Novavax stands at $1. 5 billion, according to S3. Throughout the pandemic, biotechs racing to find the next Covid-19 treatment or vaccine have captured the imagination of retail investors.  Dynavax Technologies Corp.  added another $436 million in market value on Monday on news it had both initiated a mid-stage Covid vaccine study with one partner and that the U. K.  had exercised an option to order more inoculations from another Dynavax partner using the company’s adjuvant. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.  also soared Monday after Twitter users jumped on a filing over BlackRock Inc. ’s stake in the company.  One tweet said BlackRock had doubled its position, although Bloomberg data show the stake is virtually unchanged. Meanwhile, the motivations behind Monday’s 131% rally in Healthier Choices Management Corp.  powered by Reddit was unclear as Twitter users said it was an opportunity to send hedge funds “on the run. ” Short interest in the sub-penny stock, which makes vaping products and operates health food stores in Florida, appears non-existent however.  The micro-cap’s largest holders were its management team.

Does McGregor return for an immediate rematch with Poirier? They are now 1 to 1 after two fights, although Poirier finished McGregor in spectacular fashion at UFC 257.  Is McGregor still in the mix with fighters like Poirier, Charles Oliveira, Michael Chandler, and Justin Gaethje for a shot at the UFC lightweight title? Or maybe McGregor explores a trilogy bout with Nate Diaz, while the UFC lightweight championship dust settles with the expectation that Khabib Nurmagomedov will remain retired? Joe Rogan and UFC veteran Brendan Schaub weighed in on what's next for Conor McGregor following his loss to Dustin Poirier.

That's according to four senior NATO officials, who said that there would be no full withdrawal of the 10,000 troops stationed there. The move is likely to increase tension with the Taliban, who've said there will be consequences if the deal is violated.  One NATO official told Reuters the circumstances had not been met for foreign troops to leave. Kabul and some foreign governments say the Taliban has failed to meet its promises, pointing to violence that has remained high, while also accusing them of failing to cut ties with al Qaeda. The NATO source, who wished to remain unnamed due to the sensitivity of the issue, added that under a new White House there will be tweaks to the Afghanistan policy. Last year, the then-U. S.  President Donald Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops in return for the insurgents fulfilling security guarantees. Trump hailed the accord as the end of two decades of war, but it did not include the Afghan government. Talks between Kabul and the Taliban have since stalled. What happens after April is expected to be top of the agenda at a key NATO summit this month. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said, ""No NATO ally wants to stay in Afghanistan longer than necessary, but we have been clear our presence remains conditions-based. ""The administration of Joe Biden has launched a review of the Afghanistan peace agreement. A spokesman for the Pentagon said the Taliban had not met their commitments but Washington was yet to decide on future troop levels, while, Afghanistan's presidential palace did not respond to a request for comment.

The UK is to formally ask to join The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership - or CPTPP - on Monday (February 1). Among the eleven countries it already includes are Australia, Canada, Japan and Vietnam. British trade minister, Liz Truss, will make a formal request to join on Monday when she speaks to her counterparts in Japan and New Zealand. Negotiations are expected to start later in the year. The government said joining the trans-Pacific trade group would remove tariffs on food and drink as well as cars, while helping to boost the technology and services sectors. In a statement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday (January 30), ""We are forging new partnerships that will bring enormous economic benefits for the people of Britain. ""Monday marks the first anniversary of Britain formally leaving the European Union - the world's largest trading block. Membership of the CPTPP would offer Britain access to economies that represent around 13% of global economic output. But critics claim that a trade deal with countries thousands of miles away would bring limited economic benefit to the UK.

As Perth was ordered into lockdown on Sunday (January 31), after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive for COVID-19. The city of 2 million had recorded no cases of the virus for 10 months. And Australia had just announced 14 days without a locally acquired infection, hours earlier. Shoppers in Perth flocked to the supermarkets ahead of the lockdown. Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan urged for calm:""Even though it was nearly 10 months ago, WA has experienced community transmission of this virus before.  We all did the right thing and we crushed it.  And it worked.  A 5-day lockdown.  It's crucial we act quickly to keep the community safe.  We cannot forget how quickly this virus can spread.  Nor the devastation it can cause. ""The vast, largely isolated state has been known in Australia for a hardline COVID-19 response.  That included keeping its border closed to the rest of the country until recently when it reopened to some regions. Health authorities said the security guard who tested positive was working at a hotel where four people in quarantine had active cases of the virus, including the highly contagious strains that have been linked to Britain and South Africa.

What Happened: Tenev said it had been a “surreal” week for him, in a reference to the Reddit investor-led short squeeze rally in the shares of Gamestop Corp (NYSE: GME), Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: BB) and others.  The brokerage head referred to these stocks as “meme stocks” throughout the broadcast where he appeared to clarify the events of the tumultuous week — when purchase of such stocks was restricted on the popular trading app.  Tenev said the app experienced “unprecedented volume” and “load on the system. ” He pointed out that the net buys increased exponentially.  Robinhood was among the top apps on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) respective app stores as of last week, Tenev noted.  Detailing the sequence of events that led to the suspension of buying in the Reddit-fueled stocks, he said Robinhood received a demand for $3 billion from the National Securities Clearing Corporation in the wee hours of Thursday.  NSCC provides clearing, settlement, risk management, and central counterparty services.  The executive explained that Robinhood had to put up money for the NSCC based volatility and the concentration of securities but the formula behind the demand was not fully known to him.  Why It Matters: The NSCC is not a government agency but is rather controlled by a consortium, as per Tenev.  The executive said that on Monday’s opening, some of the “stringent limits” placed on the hot stocks will be removed.  Tenev said that some limits would always be in place.  “If someone decided to deposit $100 billion and trade in one stock that’s not gonna be possible. ” “Citadel and other market makers were not involved in it,” said Tenet in reference to the trading restrictions.  NSCC had lowered its deposit requirements to $1. 4 billion after Robinhood reached out.  After explanations were given on the restrictions, the clearinghouse dropped the deposit to $ 700 million.  Tenev admitted that restricting trade was a “bad outcome for customers” but other brokers had also placed similar restrictions.  In a lighter moment in the interview, Musk asked Tenev if he was being held hostage while handing out this explanation, to which the Robinhood CEO replied in negation, saying “thanks for asking. ” Related Links: Robinhood Gets B Funding, Taps Credit Line As It Prepares To Resume Trading Of GameStop, Other Hot Stocks See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaElon Musk Talks Self-Driving, Batteries, Space, Neuralink, COVID-19 Vaccines, Bitcoin In Clubhouse AppearanceTesla, Charles Schwab — Stocks NYSRTS, One Of US' 10 Largest Pension Funds, Purchased In Q4© 2021 Benzinga. com.

Senior charge nurse Rosario Walshe leads the team at Ward A31 at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert in the Falkirk Council area and said there has been a “huge spike” in cases recently.  The PA news agency was given access to the 32-bed Covid-19 ward where every bed was taken as hospital referrals have doubled since the first wave.  Ms Walshe believes a combination of family gatherings at Christmas, people ignoring guidelines and the new rapidly-spreading variant is behind the rise.  “I’ve had patients say to me, ‘I wish I had listened, I didn’t listen.  I didn’t really believe it was real,’ so that was quite an eye opener,” she said.  “The last few weeks have been extremely busy and challenging.  It’s definitely different to the first wave.  “We’ve seen a lot more admissions with Covid-related symptoms – we’ve seen lots of groups of family members admitted with Covid, a lot of young people, which you didn’t see so much in the first wave.  “We’ve had some extremely sick people.  Patients discussed with ITU (intensive treatment unit), some transferred to ITU.  It’s definitely been a lot more challenging. ” “The reasons for it getting worse I think I can only assume that people weren’t following the guidelines.  “We’ve seen a huge spike in our cases, so I think we can all assume that family get-togethers at Christmas are one of the reasons our cases have gone up so much.  “It does annoy me slightly, lots of staff members are adhering to the policies and guidelines, trying really hard to socially distance and then you’ve got people who refuse to believe this is real.  We still have the element of people that don’t believe. ”#https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/i-didnt-believe-the-virus-was-real-covid-19-patients-told-nurse/vi-BB1dgGsz#NlcAIQUQy

Why it matters: Zelensky's comments represent a break with U. S.  national security leaders from both major political parties who are trying to rally allies to confront the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. Be smart: sign up FREE for the most influential newsletter in America. Driving the news: Asked about emerging consensus in Washington that China is the No.  1 geopolitical threat, Zelensky said, ""I cannot agree with that because in Ukraine we do not feel this. "" * ""There really is this a sort of cold war between China and the United States,"" he said.  * ""We know United States business is represented in Ukraine, but at the same time, it's true that Chinese business is also represented. "" * ""I believe that regardless of the nation, the nationality, if people, if business, if a certain country, treats you with respect, respecting your people and borders, they can be present in your country. ""Between the lines: There's only so much leverage the U. S.  has to push Zelensky away from China.  Beijing has crushed Washington at vaccine diplomacy — a painful reality that Zelensky discussed in the ""Axios on HBO"" interview.  * Zelensky has tried to obtain for his country the higher-quality American vaccines.  And he’s pushed the Europeans for their help.  But given the difficulty he’s faced to secure doses, he said he is willing to work with Beijing to get large quantities of a safe COVID vaccine for the Ukrainian people.    * Worth noting: The U. S.  did not offer its superior vaccines to Ukraine and in fact took steps to make it harder for Zelensky to obtain them. Behind the scenes: How to handle China is a growing sore point in U. S. -Ukraine relations.  Trump administration officials privately expressed concerns that China — which became Ukraine's top trading partner in 2019 — was flooding Ukraine with easy cash and in return embedding itself in Ukraine's critical sectors including defense and telecom.  * U. S.  officials are worried about China stealing intelligence secrets and wielding nefarious influence over allies who are increasingly beholden to Beijing. Yes, but: Senior U. S.  government officials have been trying for years to persuade Ukraine to stop China from buying Motor Sich, an aero engine manufacturer that is the crown jewel of Ukraine's defense sector.  * In the interview, Zelensky said for the first time definitively that he will not allow China, or any other country, to buy a controlling stake in Motor Sich.  * ""Never,"" he said.  ""Not under me.  I am not here for life. . .  [But] in my time [in office], definitely not. The bottom line: Russia is a far more imminent concern for Ukraine.  But when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, China never condemned Russia's action.  So while Zelensky may not call out China as a threat, he knows that China can't be relied upon in a Russia-Ukraine crisis. Support safe, smart, sane journalism.  Sign up for Axios Newsletters here.

Israel has been praised globally for its speedy vaccination efforts.  And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promoted a quick vaccination of Israel's most vulnerable and the lockdown as dual pathways to a possible reopening of the economy in February. But serious cases have surged among Israelis who have not yet been vaccinated. Officials blame this on foreign virus strains and on lockdown breaches.  Israel's often high-density Ultra-Orthodox communities make up around 15% of the population. But account for some 35% of recent contagions according to the Health Ministry. They are among the conservative Netanyahu's supporters and their violations have been played up by political rivals in questioning the lockdown's efficacy - and building opposition to the Prime Minister ahead of a March 23 election. #https://news.yahoo.com/thousands-ultra-orthodox-jews-defy-174321260.html#3QtVmxiAu

But that's not what's happening, says one expert, and that could mean that if and when the short squeeze does come GameStop's price could soar significantly higher than current levels. What's happening: Short sellers have piled into GameStop as a result of its meteoric stock price rise, not the other way around, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, told Axios. Support safe, smart, sane journalism.  Sign up for Axios Newsletters here.  * Over the past year the amount of shares shorted has increased by 12%, while the total dollars at risk have risen by 1,900%, S3's data show.  * That's a sign that big bets are coming in from hedge funds and institutional investors, meaning that the short squeeze has not even begun. How it works: In a typical short squeeze, short sellers have sold the stock and ""rented"" shares with the intent to buy them after the stock's price falls.  But they are ""squeezed"" out if the price rises too much and they are forced to exit the trade by buying the stock at a higher price.  * That helps the value of the stock rise because the short sellers join the momentum pushing the price higher.  * But with GameStop, every time a short seller exits the market and buys shares, new short sellers are coming in to replace them, keeping the same downward pressure on the price and, in fact, short interest is increasing. What it means: ""That tells me what’s moving the market is the long buyers.  This is not a short covering rally,"" Dusaniwsky said.  * ""If it was I would see shares shorted dropping precipitously.  For this kind of price move, I would have to see short interest being wiped out. "" * ""One way I can see short interest is not being wiped out is because the stock borrow rate is getting higher.  * ""That means shorts are not getting out on a net basis.

During a Jan.  28 interview with MSNBC, chief White House COVID adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, recently name dropped two side effects in particular that he feels should be viewed as a welcome sign that your immune system is responding to your vaccination.  Read on to find out which side effects are good news, and for Fauci's firsthand account of getting the COVID vaccine, check out Dr.  Fauci Says He Had These Side Effects From His Second Vaccine Dose. Fauci explained that the two unpleasant side effects in particular are not cause for worry, but for reassurance.  ""The vaccine, because you're giving it in the arm, it gives a systemic reaction.  You know that because sometimes after the second dose you feel a little achy, a little chilly, which means the immune system is really getting revved up,"" Fauci explained. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that's because the two mRNA COVID vaccines currently approved in the U. S. , from Pfizer and Moderna, do not inject recipients with inactivated virus.  Instead, they teach our own cells to mimic certain features of the COVID virus so that our immune systems can train to fight against it later, if needed. Specifically, the COVID vaccines work by instructing our cells to recreate their own version of the ""spike protein"" found on the outside of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  As more cells create these spike proteins, our immune systems ""recognize that the protein doesn't belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19,"" the CDC says.  So, if you feel those aches and chills that Fauci mentioned, rest assured: that's just your immune system firing up to take down a perceived threat. Wondering what other side effects you might expect after getting your shot? Read on for the most common COVID vaccine side effects that Moderna patients reported, and for more essential vaccine news, check out If You're Over 65, You Shouldn't Get This New Vaccine, Experts Warn.  4 Joint pain Joint pain, known medically as arthralgia, is the fourth most common side effects reported by vaccine recipients: nearly half of those enrolled in the Moderna trials—46 percent, to be exact—experienced this particular side effect in the hours or days after receiving the shot.  And for more on what you shouldn't do before you get your vaccine, check out If You Take These OTC Meds, You Have to Stop Before Getting the Vaccine.  3 Headache Headaches were reported slightly more frequently than joint pain, with 64 percent of patients in Moderna trials experiencing this particular side effect.  According to the CDC, headaches tend to be more common after the second dose. While a study published in the Journal of Virology warned that taking over-the-counter pain medication prior to getting the shot may blunt the efficacy of the vaccines, experts say it's fine to take them afterward to treat vaccine side effects, including a headache.  And for another possible delayed reaction to the shot, check out This COVID Vaccine Side Effect Could Show Up a Week After Your Shot.  2 Fatigue If you experience sudden exhaustion after getting your COVID shot, you're not alone: about 70 percent of Moderna vaccine recipients reported feeling fatigued after their vaccination, making it the second most common side effect. For this reason, you may want to schedule your shot when you know you'll have time to rest afterward, if possible—for example, on a lighter workday, or at the end of your work week.  In fact, after personally experiencing side effects from the COVID shot, infectious disease epidemiologist Saskia Popescu, PhD, recently urged, ""We need to ensure folks have the ability to take time off post-shot. "" And for more regular COVID news delivered right to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.  1 Pain at the injection site The most common side effect reported by Moderna recipients was pain at the injection site: 92 percent of those vaccinated experienced this sensation. ""There are two types of COVID-19 vaccine side effects,"" Teresa Bartlett, MD, senior medical officer at medical claims company Sedgwick, recently told Bustle.  While systemic side effects affect broader body function (fever, chills, and aches are all prime examples), ""local side effects are more common, and involve redness, swelling and perhaps some lymph node swelling in the vaccinated arm. "" And for more on that last side effect she mentioned, check out The Rare COVID Vaccine Side Effect Doctors Want You to Prepare For.

It's also their first third-person horror game, employing a mixture of fixed camera angles reminiscent of 1990s genre classics, first-person bits where you investigate objects for clues, and split-screen sections that simultaneously show what you're up to in the real world as well as a ghostly supernatural otherworld. It's a combat-free experience, focused on using your spirit powers to solve puzzles and a bit of stealth.  Though it's apparently got some performance issues, our reviewer enjoyed The Medium immensely, saying that, ""What it lacks in technical polish it makes up for with chilling set pieces and thoughtful plot developments. ""The Medium is available on Game Pass, Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-medium-has-already-earned-back-its-development-and-promotion-costs/#TWN0JwIAF

However, Mark Zuckerberg failed to persuade lawmakers to change the policy, according to Reuters.  The report also says that Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told Australian Broadcasting Corp, “No, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t convince me to back down if that’s what you’re asking. ” According to the proposed law, news media outlets can negotiate collectively or individually, over content that drives traffic to Facebook and Google’s websites.  If these parties fail to reach an agreement, an arbitrator appointed by the Australian Government will set the fees for both parties.  In view of this proposed law, earlier this month, Facebook had said that it will stop news sharing if the Australian government proceeds while Google threatened to withdraw its search engine from the country.  Companies like Facebook are opposing this law as it would mean an increase in compliance costs and could also put a dent in its advertising revenues as the proposed law also states that companies will have to share their consumer data from such news content.  Advertising is a major source of revenue for Facebook.  (See Facebook stock analysis on TipRanks) In the fourth quarter, Facebook reported advertising revenues of $27. 2 billion, up by 31% year-on-year.  The advertising business made up about 96. 8% of total revenues in 4Q for the company.  Mark Zuckerberg also warned of the timing of “platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape,” during Facebook’s 4Q results.  William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart reiterated a Buy rating on the stock on Jan.  28.  Commenting on the company’s 4Q results, Schackart noted, “In the first half of 2021, Facebook will lap a period of growth that was negatively affected by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic.  Thus, year-over year growth rates in total revenue are expected to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially during the first and second quarters of 2021. ” “In the second half of the year, Facebook will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which is expected to put significant pressure on year-over-year growth rates,” Schackart added.  The rest of the Street is bullish about the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating.  That’s based on 35 analysts recommending a Buy, 3 analysts suggesting a Hold, and one analyst recommending a Sell.  The average analyst price target of $341. 28 implies a 32. 1% upside potential to current levels.

After giving voice to people consumed by “The Shining” (“Room 237”), ventriloquist dummies (“The Wooden Boy”) and sleep paralysis (“The Nightmare”), he’s shifted his attention to simulation theory with “Glitch in the Matrix,” premiering at Sundance just before it goes into wider release.  A subject tailor-made for college, festival and midnight audiences, simulation theory questions human determination by positing that we are merely avatars, and that some greater force — an external gamer, if you will — is our master manipulator.  Much of this concept comes directly from sci-fi writer Philip K.  Dick, who is copiously represented throughout “Glitch. ” Ascher makes much use of a recorded 1977 event in which Dick presents these ideas with utmost sincerity, even while admitting that “I may be talking about something which does not exist.  Therefore, I am free to say everything and nothing. ” Also Read: Rodney Ascher's 'A Glitch in the Matrix' Acquired by Magnolia Ahead of Sundance Premiere Ascher takes a similar approach, wandering through as many musings that’ll elicit a “What?” as much as a “Whoa. ” Speaking of which, it may not surprise anyone to learn that Keanu Reeves is the icon of this ideology, just as “The Matrix” trilogy is its Bible.  He doesn’t, as far as we know, consider these films to be anything beyond fantasy, but there are lots of interviews with adherents like Brother Læo Mystwood, who came to his beliefs after noticing a pattern of synchronicities (some viewers might call them coincidences) in his life.  Ascher transforms many of his subjects into Fortnight-style characters themselves, an approach that feels alternately inspired and unfortunate.  On the one hand, using 3D motion-capture animation to turn people who believe they may be avatars into actual avatars offers a cheeky, if on-the-nose, bit of visual parallelism.  And since we never see their true appearance, they’re afforded privacy while sharing their controversial views.

Dick Android That said, neither anonymity nor resemblance to a competitor on “The Masked Singer” does much to boost anyone’s credibility.  In truth, many of them seem to be vulnerable individuals searching for comfort, rather than philosophers or theorists.  But just as we realize this, Ascher shifts into an examination of the reasons simulation and false identity theories have proven popular among adherents.  We’re reminded of the movies that paved the way for cultural infiltration, including Dick adaptations like “Blade Runner,” “Total Recall,” “A Scanner Darkly” and “Minority Report. ” And, of course, there is the franchise that gives this film its name.  In the most troubling, and most memorable, segment, we hear Joshua Cooke describe in detail the events that led to the murder of his parents, while the camera brings us there virtually though animated photogrammetry.  Also Read: Lilly Wachowski Tells Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump 'F-- Both of You' After They Quote 'The Matrix' Cooke connected with Reeves’ character Neo to such a degree that his lawyers prepped a “Matrix Defense,” an insanity plea based on the idea that he deeply believed in a parallel reality.  Ascher leaves us pondering the costs of dissociation, but also its seductive appeal.  Is it really that outlandish to look around occasionally, and wonder at the surreality of it all? “Glitch in the Matrix” opens in select theaters and on-demand Feb.  5.  ﻿ Read original story ‘Glitch in the Matrix’ Film Review: Trippy Documentary Questions the Nature of Reality At TheWrap#https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/glitch-matrix-film-review-trippy-065449379.html#vA5q49xxi

The film is directed by Clint Bentley in his directorial debut and written by Bentley and Greg Kwedar.  It stars Clifton Collins Jr. , Molly Parker, Moises Arias, Logan Cormier and Colleen Hartnett.  Collins stars as an aging jockey who hopes to win one last title for his longtime trainer (Parker), who has acquired what appears to be a championship horse.  But the years — and injuries — have taken a toll on his body, throwing into question his ability to continue his lifelong passion.  The arrival of a young rookie rider (Arias), who claims to be his son and whom he takes under his wing, further complicates the path to fulfilling his dream.  Also Read: 'CODA' Sells to Apple for Record-Breaking $25 Million After Sundance Bidding War The main character in “Jockey” was written specifically for Collins and was based in part on Bentley’s own father, who was also a professional jockey.  The filmmakers spent time on the race track for months before shooting, and the entire supporting cast is made up of real-life jockeys.  “Jockey” is produced by Bentley, Kwedar and Nancy Schafer and executive produced by Larry Kalas, Larry Kelly, Linda and Jon Halbert, Cheryl and Walt Penn, Genevieve and Mark Crozier, Cindy and John Greenwood, Ann Grimes and Jay Old, Benjamin Fuqua, Jordy Wax and Collins Jr.  “Filmmakers Clint Bentley, co-writer Greg Kwedar and producer Nancy Schafer have made such a good movie, that is engaging, satisfying, visual, and precise cinematic storytelling,” Sony Pictures Classics said in a statement.  “Anchored by a truly amazing performance by Clifton Collins Jr. , an actor we have admired in so many roles for over 2 decades, ably supported by Molly Parker and Moses Arias, ‘Jockey’ is about what happens to a professional at the end of a career with the background of horse racing, a subject of interest to audiences worldwide.  We are excited to bring the movie to a wide audience this year. ” Also Read: 'The Sparks Brothers' Film Review: Edgar Wright Makes Playful Documentary About Elusive Band Sparks “We’re overjoyed Sony Pictures Classics will be releasing ‘Jockey. ’ Growing up, watching movies with their logo made us the filmmakers we are today,” said Bentley and Kwedar.  “We were so taken by SPC’s passion and vision and our shared love for Clifton Collins Jr.  It’s surreal for our movie to be in the family of so many incredible films and filmmakers.  This movie was made with so much love, in the vibrant, itinerant world behind the racetrack.  It’s an honor to partner with Michael Barker, Tom Bernard and their team who take such care in how they release films. ” “Through my years of programming film festivals, I would beg Michael and Tom for their latest releases to include in my fests.  They handled the best films from around the world with love and care so it’s a joy to see ‘Jockey’ joining this auspicious line-up,” Schafer said in a statement.  Sony Pictures Classics negotiated the deal with ICM Partners, on behalf of the filmmakers.  International sales were handled by Films Boutique.
