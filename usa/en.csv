Ark ETFs include the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK), Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE: ARKW), Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS: ARKG), Ark Fintech Innotvation ETF (NYSE: ARKF) and Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS: ARKQ).  The themes presented by Cathie Wood and her team could provide hints at which companies in the future could be included in the ETFs.  Here is a look at some potential candidates based on the Ark Funds 2021 Big Ideas.  1.  Desktop Metal: 3D printing company Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM) fits the profile of the 3D printing theme revolutionizing manufacturing.  Desktop Metal is included in the 3D Printing ETF (BATS: PRNT) and based on the comments from Ark could soon be added to additional ETFs from the company.  Chamath Palihapitiya is an investor in the company.  The so-called SPAC King calls Desktop Metal a leader in the new era of printing and said it can work with automotive and aerospace companies to create parts with less weight.  This production scale is considered the holy grail.  Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is another investor in the company.  2.  AST & Science: Going public via a SPAC deal with New Providence Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: NPA), AST & Science is bringing its ambitious plans for 5G from space to the public markets.  The company seems like a perfect fit for Ark’s Big Idea of orbital aerospace.  Under this idea, Ark calls for satellite broadband to see strong revenue growth in the future.  AST is targeting the $1 trillion global mobile wireless service market.  AST said that 51% of the global population does not have mobile broadband.  The company’s plans call for launching over 180 satellites to bring 5G access to customers with a goal of hitting 373 million subscribers by 2027.

Brooks Automation: One Big Idea theme is automation, a sector that Brooks Automation (NASDAQ: BRKS) fits into.  Brooks Automation powers the semiconductor and life sciences sectors with robots and automations.  With the focus on automation and robotics across several Ark funds, this could be a stock worth watching for investors.  6.  EHang Holdings: Autonomous aerial vehicle company EHang Holdings (NASDAQ: EH) is up over 450% in the last year.  The company has become one of the ways for investors to get exposure to the growing passenger transport and logistics for urban air mobility.

The world’s richest person shows no signs of changing his ways as U. S.  President Joe Biden takes office and bolsters the regulatory agencies defanged by his predecessor. In the past week alone, Musk has tangled with the Federal Aviation Administration over a December rocket test flight that ended in flames and begrudgingly agreed to recall some Tesla cars at highway-safety officials’ urging.  And while he announced Tuesday he was taking a break from Twitter -- the platform that previously got him fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- Musk had already used his favorite social-media megaphone in the preceding days to roil stocks of companies from Etsy Inc.  to Shopify Inc.  during a retail-trading frenzy. The potential for more conflict is building as Biden works to confirm his cabinet secretaries and reinvigorate agencies following the Donald Trump era.  Democratic administrations have historically been tougher on industry regulation, and Musk’s empire intersects with government oversight of automobiles, spaceflight, energy, telecommunications and medical equipment. In a series of comments on Tuesday, the FAA said that Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  had ignored the agency back on Dec.  9 to go ahead with a test launch of its massive Starship rocket -- a test that ended in a blazing fireball when the prototype malfunctioned on landing.  The FAA said it had turned down SpaceX ’s request to exceed the maximum public risk for that launch, and after the explosion had suspended testing at the site until a company-led investigation was complete and its regulators approved SpaceX’s corrective actions. The FAA’s comments added some clarity to the dispute that led to an angry tweet from Musk on Jan.  28 in which he accused the agency of having a “fundamentally broken regulatory structure. ” His ire against the FAA was triggered after another SpaceX test flight was delayed. Without giving much detail, the FAA in a Tuesday morning email said that SpaceX was now in compliance and could proceed with another test.  Within hours, the unmanned Starship SN-9 lifted off from SpaceX’s seaside launch pad at 2:25 p. m.  Tuesday in Boca Chica, Texas, flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (6. 2 miles) -- and exploded as it attempted to land, like the earlier rocket. Later in the day, the agency said it will lead the investigation into the latest “landing mishap” and look for other ways to enhance safety. Meanwhile, Tesla has been engaged in a long back and forth with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the failure of touch screens in some of its Model S and Model X vehicles.  Last month, NHTSA sent a letter to Tesla saying it had determined the failures constituted a defect.  Tesla responded that it “respectfully disagrees” with the finding but will voluntarily initiate a recall.  Impacted Tesla customers received emails that said they will be notified “when the parts become available. ”“Tesla makes it very clear that they don’t think this is necessary, but they are doing this to make the issue go away,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business, in a phone interview Tuesday.  “If NHTSA had not written the recall request letter, Tesla would not have done this. ”Musk, 49, is widely heralded for disrupting the auto industry with high performance electric cars and upending Big Aerospace with reusable rockets. His companies are growing: Tesla is building two new factories in Berlin and in Austin, Texas, while SpaceX -- which has contracts with the Air Force and NASA -- is rolling out Starlink, its high speed Internet service, to rural and remote customers across the U. S. , Canada and the U. K.  There’s also the Boring Co. , his tunnel-construction business, and Neuralink, which is testing its brain machine interface device on monkeys and pigs and hopes to begin human trials this year. Musk’s frustration with regulators is legendary. He once hung up during a testy call with the head of the National Transportation Safety Board over Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system; the NTSB was irked in part by the company’s public comments about a crash probe.  Tesla has aggressively pushed out Autopilot -- including what it calls a Full Self-Driving upgrade -- much to the consternation of some safety advocates, even as driverless tech rivals like Google parent Alphabet Inc. ’s Waymo unit in recent weeks have taken pains to be more transparent and circumspect with their claims. When public health officials in California’s Alameda County ordered Tesla to close its factory last spring, Musk railed against the shut down orders as “fascist” on the company’s earnings call.  And despite settling with the SEC over his failed go-private bid in 2018, Musk has continued to taunt the agency, referring to them as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission. ”The settlement stripped Musk of the chairmanship of Tesla’s board for three years, meaning he could potentially resume the role this fall -- just as the Biden administration is re-establishing the government’s role in oversight.

2021-02-03 11:43:39#tech#AMD's supply issue is harming its best chance of gaining market share#https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2020/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mnzNfoMcmVXme8vxENcyjm-1200-80.jpg#en#0.765#www.pcgamer.com#After the past couple of years, it may be tough to believe what I'm about to say, but here we go: Intel is currently beating AMD in CPU pricing and availability.  The result of which, according to a report from Mercury Research, is that AMD is actually losing market share for the first time since 2017. Off the back of its technical expertise with the Zen CPU architecture, AMD has been snapping up market share these past few years.  Most recently, and according to Mercury Research (via Tom's Hardware), its desktop offerings accounted for 20. 1 percent of the market.  A significant increase from 9. 9 percent back in 2016. There have been similar gains for AMD in mobile processors and, to a lesser extent, in servers too.  The latter is to be expected, however, as switching servers progresses much slower than with us fickle gaming lot on desktop. The latest numbers show that AMD's momentum has slowed a little over the course of the final three months of 2020.  Its desktop processor share shrunk by 0. 8 percent and its mobile share by 1. 2 percent compared to the previous quarter. We can speculate on reasons why, but as Tom's Hardware rightly points out, it's not for a lack of x86 processor sales.  In fact, business is booming, and AMD should be crushing it with its most impressive CPU architecture to date. Mercury Research reports that the x86 market processor grew at 20. 1 percent for the quarter.  Paired with AMD's strong growth from recent earnings reports, it's understandably not as much a question of demand as it is of supply. #https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2020/#aZ2sUDCAi

The last game, Battlefield 5, was released in September of 2018—making this the longest gap between games in the series' history.  But good news Battlefield fans: EA confirmed that a new Battlefield is releasing this fall and will be revealed later this spring. During EA's earning's call today, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that more information about the ""next Battlefield experience,"" which is due sometime this holiday season, would be revealed ""in the months ahead. ""It's not much to go on, but it's the first news we've had regarding Battlefield since November, when Wilson said it would feature ""never-before-seen scale. "" He reiterated that promise today, saying that the game ""takes full advantage of the power of next generation platforms to bring massive, and immersive battles to life with more players than ever before. ""Featuring maps with unprecedented scale, the next Battlefield takes all the destruction, player agency, vehicle and weapon combat that the franchise is known for, and elevates it to the next level,"" Wilson added. When pressed for more details later in the call, Wilson said:  ""We don't have anything more to share with you at this point other than we believe it's going to usher in a new generation for Battlefield games and Battlefield fans, and we'll be benefitting from the full power of next-gen platforms.  You should imagine we're looking across all forms of the experience to ensure it's exactly the game that Battlefield fans want to play.

The stock, which recently ended development of an experimental therapy for Covid-19, rallied to close 39% higher on Monday after a poster on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum called it “the most undervalued stock in the market” while another said a brewing BioWar was “about sticking it to the shorts in a massive way. ”​Biotechs with little to no revenue have long been the focus of short bets on Wall Street and could emerge as a new focal point for small-time investors railing against elite hedge funds.  But the battleground is an already crowded arena with hedge funds positioned on both sides. Indeed, BioCryst is a short target with about 17% of float, or $259 million, sold short, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.  But it’s also a hedge fund pick held by the likes of Citadel, the well-known biotech outfit Baker Bros.  Advisors LP, and activist investor Alex Denner’s Sarissa Capital Management. Before Monday’s rally, shares of BioCryst had already shrugged off the scuttling of a Covid-19 trial supported by the National Institutes of Health.  The company is expected to generate less than $31 million in revenue for all of 2020. Novavax Inc. , another heavily-shorted biotech, has also garnered interest across chat forums, which could benefit funds like RA Capital Management and Perceptive Advisors, which hold stakes in the company.  The stock has more than doubled in the past few trading days, albeit on late-stage positive results for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.  The short position on Novavax stands at $1. 5 billion, according to S3. Throughout the pandemic, biotechs racing to find the next Covid-19 treatment or vaccine have captured the imagination of retail investors.  Dynavax Technologies Corp.  added another $436 million in market value on Monday on news it had both initiated a mid-stage Covid vaccine study with one partner and that the U. K.  had exercised an option to order more inoculations from another Dynavax partner using the company’s adjuvant. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.  also soared Monday after Twitter users jumped on a filing over BlackRock Inc. ’s stake in the company.  One tweet said BlackRock had doubled its position, although Bloomberg data show the stake is virtually unchanged. Meanwhile, the motivations behind Monday’s 131% rally in Healthier Choices Management Corp.  powered by Reddit was unclear as Twitter users said it was an opportunity to send hedge funds “on the run. ” Short interest in the sub-penny stock, which makes vaping products and operates health food stores in Florida, appears non-existent however.  The micro-cap’s largest holders were its management team.
