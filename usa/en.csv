Then-Senator Harry Reid started this clearcutting of the rules back in 2013.  He used the “nuclear option” to lower the vote threshold for confirmation in order to stack the D. C.  Circuit Court of Appeals.  Senator Mitch McConnell escalated by using the same standard to confirm Supreme Court nominees.  As Majority Leader Chuck Schumer toys with the idea of blowing up the legislative filibuster as well, he is potentially poised to first unravel another important — if lesser-known — Senate rule in pursuit of an all-encompassing COVID-relief bill under the terms of “budget reconciliation. ” We’re talking about the Byrd Rule (named after the late Senator Robert Byrd), which limits the ability of the majority to stuff extraneous legislative goodies into budget-related proposals and still pass them with a simple-majority vote under that process.  Senator Byrd saw the danger of using reconciliation, which limits amendments and debate, to pursue broader, non-budgetary legislation outside regular order.  As a defender of the right of all senators to debate and amend legislation, he fastened these restrictions onto the reconciliation process.  This is for the greater good: the Byrd Rule protects Social Security from the reconciliation process, for instance, while limiting committees to proposals in their jurisdiction and requiring that the budget relevance of any proposal considered under this process be more than “merely incidental. ” What this means is that major legislative policy changes can be made only when all senators have the right to fully debate and amend legislation — and to filibuster.  Reconciliation otherwise “streamlines” this process at the expense of the minority.  Today, fueled by rage and revenge, the leaders of the Senate care nothing for the reasons behind the rules; they want only to pass their legislation as quickly as possible.  Most of the attention these past weeks has gone to the $15 minimum wage contained inside the COVID-relief package.  This hardly meets the reconciliation standard on its own, but there will be other violations of the Byrd Rule in the bill the House will send to the Senate.  That’s why Senate Democrats could aim to break the glass on Senate rules.  As described by parliamentary expert Martin Gold, there are two ways to achieve this.  First, there’s the more targeted attack on the Byrd Rule.  Say Vice President Harris is in the chair when a senator raises a point of order against, for example, the minimum-wage hike.  The Senate parliamentarian advises her that this particular section of the reconciliation bill is out of order.  Despite all evidence and precedent that the section is out of order, the VP rules otherwise.  Now the section takes only a simple majority to pass.  However, if a senator who supports the Byrd Rule challenges the ruling of the chair, it will require a 60-vote majority to overrule Harris.  That’s a high bar.  So here, the chair’s judgment, which likely would stand, changes the precedent so that any other item in the bill that violates the Byrd Rule can be ruled acceptable under the new standard just established by the vice president.  Republicans would have loved this when they were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, but they respected Senate rules protecting the rights of the minority.  This limited, surgical strike on the Byrd Rule would still disrupt the precedent in perpetuity.  Meanwhile, there’s a broader attack that could be implemented.  In this scenario, the majority leader addresses the chair and says that waiving the Byrd Rule only takes a simple-majority vote.  It is clear under the rules and the precedents that this is false.  If the chair rules that it takes 60 votes to waive the Byrd Rule, the majority leader then appeals the ruling of the chair, which takes a simple-majority vote to overturn.  Bingo — the protections of the Byrd Rule are dead, and now it takes only a simple-majority vote to put any legislative proposal the majority wants into the budget-reconciliation bill, bypassing legitimate debate and amendment.  The result of this action would threaten any rule in the Senate.  If at any time the majority wants to get rid of any rule, all they would have to do is appeal the ruling of the chair and muster a simple majority — silencing the opposition and forcing their will on the American people.  Once upon a time, the U. S.  Senate was called the world’s greatest deliberative body.  As envisioned by Thomas Jefferson, there were rules that protected the minority and allowed for thorough debate.  Sadly, it appears this current Senate majority cares little for the precedents that earned the U. S.  Senate that title.  But some caution on their part might be well-advised self-interest; tables have been known to turn. #https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-flirt-destroying-another-senate-113044242.html#NH2IcnmOg

S Capitol. The final tally fell short of the 67 votes needed to convict.  But with 57 votes in favor of a conviction versus 43 against, the outcome reflected an unprecedented condemnation of a president. ""It was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in the history of our republic. ""Colorado Democratic Representative Joe Neguse, one of the House Managers who prosecuted the case against Trump, on Sunday (February 14) praised the seven Republican senators who joined with Democrats in voting to convict. ""Fifty-seven senators, including seven Republicans that you mentioned, chose country over party, and reached the same conclusion we did, which is that the president incited insurrection.  And we shouldn't loose sight of that. ""Even some Republicans who voted Saturday to acquit - such as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - harshly condemned Trump for his role in the riot. ""There is no question - none - that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.  No question about it. ""McConnell said his vote hinged on a technicality - his belief that a former president could not be be impeached. Trump's legal team, including attorney Michael Van Der Veen hailed their victory. ""We won.  Not guilty. "" And a Trump spokesperson read a statement from the former president. ""This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. ""But the end of the trial does not mean the end of Trump's potential legal jeopardy. A prosecutor in Georgia has launched a criminal probe into the former president's efforts to overturn that state's election.  On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported the Manhattan prosecutor is looking into loans to Trump properties. Mitch McConnell even suggested Trump may still face criminal liability. ""Unless the statute of limitations is run, still liable for everything he did while he was in office.  Didn't get away with anything.  Yet.  Yet.

2021-02-14 17:58:03#business#Bendable concrete and other CO2-infused cement mixes could dramatically cut global emissions#https://news.yahoo.com/bendable-concrete-other-co2-infused-175803665.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kXps1x_gRppcXOwvP7JRTQ--~B/aD05NTg7dz0xNDQwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_us_articles_815/24673f52f102bbb01a978b78dd70c314#en#-0.2732#news.yahoo.com#Bendable concrete created at the University of Michigan allows for thinner structures with less need for steel reinforcement.  Joseph Xu/University of Michigan College of EngineeringOne of the big contributors to climate change is right beneath your feet, and transforming it could be a powerful solution for keeping greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.  The production of cement, the binding element in concrete, accounted for 7% of total global carbon dioxide emissions in 2018.  Concrete is one of the most-used resources on Earth, with an estimated 26 billion tons produced annually worldwide.  That production isn’t expected to slow down for at least two more decades.  Given the scale of the industry and its greenhouse gas emissions, technologies that can reinvent concrete could have profound impacts on climate change.  As engineers working on issues involving infrastructure and construction, we have been designing the next generation of concrete technology that can reduce infrastructure’s carbon footprint and increase durability.  That includes CO2-infused concrete that locks up the greenhouse gas and can be stronger and even bendable.  The industry is ripe for dramatic change, particularly with the Biden administration promising to invest big in infrastructure projects and cut U. S.  emissions at the same time.  However, to put CO2 to work in concrete on a wide scale in a way that drastically cuts emissions, all of its related emissions must be taken into account.  Rethinking concrete Concrete is made up of aggregate materials – primarily rocks and sand – along with cement and water.  Because about 80% of concrete’s carbon footprint comes from cement, researchers have been working to find substitute materials.  Industrial byproducts such as iron slag and coal fly ash are now frequently used to reduce the amount of cement needed.  The resulting concrete can have significantly lower emissions because of that change.  Alternative binders, such as limestone calcined clay, can also reduce cement use.  One study found that using limestone and calcinated clay could reduce emissions by at least 20% while also cutting production costs.  Apart from developing blended cements, researchers and companies are focusing on ways to use captured CO2 as an ingredient in the concrete itself, locking it away and preventing it from entering the atmosphere.  CO2 can be added in the form of aggregates – or injected during mixing.  Carbonation curing, also known as CO2 curing, can also be used after concrete has been cast.  These processes turn CO2 from a gas to a mineral, creating solid carbonates that may also improve the strength of concrete.  That means structures may need less cement, reducing the amount of related emissions.  Companies such as CarbonCure and Solidia have developed technologies to use these processes for concrete poured at construction sites and in precast concrete, such as cinder blocks and other construction materials.  Carbon dioxide can make up a significant percentage of concrete mass.  Lucca Henrion/University of Michigan, CC BY-ND The Kitahama building, the tallest residential tower in Japan, is built with bendable concrete for earthquake resistance.  MC681/Wikimedia Commons At the University of Michigan, we are working on composites that produce a bendable concrete material that allows thinner, less brittle structures that require less steel reinforcement, further reducing related carbon emissions.  The material can be engineered to maximize the amount of CO2 it can store by using smaller particles that readily react with CO2, turning it to mineral.  The CO2-based bendable concrete can be used for general buildings, water and energy infrastructure, as well as transportation infrastructure.  Bendable concrete was used in the 61-story Kitahama tower in Osaka, Japan, and roadway bridge slabs in Ypsilanti, Michigan.  The challenge of lifecycle emissions These cutting-edge technologies can start addressing concrete infrastructure’s carbon footprint, but barriers still exist.  In a study published Feb.  8, three of us looked at the lifecycle emissions from infusing CO2 into concrete and found that estimates did not always account for emissions from CO2 capture, transportation and use.  With colleagues, we came up with strategies for ensuring that carbon curing has a strong emissions benefit.  Overall, we recommend developing a standard CO2 curing protocol.  Lab experiments show that CO2 curing can improve concrete’s strength and durability, but results vary with specific curing procedures and concrete mixes.  Research can improve the conditions and the timing of steps in the curing process to increase concrete’s performance.  Electricity use – the largest emissions source during curing – can also be reduced by streamlining the process and possibly by using waste heat.  [Deep knowledge, daily.  Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter. ] Advanced concrete mixes, bendable concrete in particular, already begin to address these issues by increasing durability.  Merging infrastructure and climate policy In 2020, a wide range of companies announced steps to reduce their emissions.  However, government investment and procurement policies are still needed to transform the construction industry.  Local governments are taking the first steps.  “Low embodied carbon concrete” rules and projects to reduce the amount of cement in concrete have cropped up around the country, including in Marin County, California; Hastings-on-Hudson, New York; and a sidewalk pilot in Portland, Oregon.  In New York and New Jersey, lawmakers have proposed state-level policies that would provide price discounts in the bidding process to proposals with the lowest emissions from concrete.  These policies could serve as a blueprint for reducing carbon emissions from concrete production and other building materials.  A lot of North American infrastructure is in a state of disrepair.  Achim Herring/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY Nationally, the crumbling of federally managed infrastructure has been a steadily growing crisis.  The Biden administration could start to address those problems, as well as climate change, and create jobs through a strategic infrastructure program.  Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg recently declared that there were “enormous opportunities for job creation, equity and climate achievement when it comes to advancing America’s infrastructure. ” Policies that elevate low-carbon concrete to a nationwide climate solution could follow.

This time, it will touch on a variety of updates on the state of Baldur's Gate 3 and the forthcoming patch 4, ""including the biggest patch note ever forged in the fiery pits of Larian"", and will also include ""a peek at newly improved cinematics, Tieflings, spells and cows"". Patch 4 is coming soon, and like the previous patch it will break your savegame unless you hop over into the beta branch.  Which is easy enough to do, if you're playing on Steam.  Right-click Baldur's Gate 3 in your Steam library, select properties and then the betas tab, opt into the patch 3 branch and your current playthrough will remain safe.  If you're playing on Stadia, unfortunately you're out of luck. The Panel From Hell 2 will be hosted by Larian's creative director Swen Vincke and Wizards of the Coast's principal rules designer of Dungeons & Dragons, Jeremy Crawford, and will feature various guests.  As a climax, there's going to be a live stream of ""the latest content from Baldur's Gate 3's biggest update yet. ""The Panel from Hell 2 will take place on February 17 at 10am PT, and you can watch it on Larian's Twitch, YouTube, or Steam channels. Here's everything we know about Baldur's Gate 3.

At a certain point a few years ago, it became associated with the Joker, as people would tweet or share it with a photo of the character — despite the fact that the character has never actually said the line out loud.  Until now.  We can’t help but assume that this bit is some kind of troll from director Zack Snyder — although of course we don’t know if this was something that was originally supposed to be in the movie or if it’s something that was added for the “Justice League” Snyder Cut.  Also Read: The 10 Most Terrifying Shots of Superman's CGI Mouth in the 'Justice League' Theatrical Cut But the way the line is presented in the Snyder Cut trailer is so perfectly pointed, you can’t even pretend it’s not intentional.  So it’s no wonder fans are losing their minds over it.  After all this time, the “Justice League” Snyder Cut really is almost upon us, and it brought with it “Credit where credit’s due: having Leto Joker actually say “we live in a society” in that trailer is some grade-A trolling and I respect it,” tweeted journalist Scott Wampler.  “Did Snyder not get the memo that WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY was an ironic meme??” asked a fan.  Even Leto got in on the fun, tweeting the line along with the trailer.  Also Read: The Worst Parts of 'Justice League' Theatrical Cut, From Superman's CGI Mouth to That Underwater Battle Though the trailer didn’t give away a lot in terms of the rejiggered plot of this new version, it did give us an exciting look at what we can expect visually when the film drops on March 18 on HBO Max: Darkseid and a lot of fighting between the Justice League, DeSaad and Steppenwolf.  We’ll know more when the Snyder Cut of “Justice League” premieres in a few weeks, but until then we’ve got a brand-new spin on an old meme to tide us over.  Thank you, Zack Snyder.
