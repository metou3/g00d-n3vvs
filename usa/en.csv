Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates formalised ties with Israel on Sept.  15 in part over shared concerns about Iran, in a deal forged by former U. S.  President Donald Trump.  Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, a move praised by Israel which has objected to the accord. #https://news.yahoo.com/israel-bahrain-leaders-discuss-netanyahu-095923787.html#wChYibDLo

Lockdowns to slow the pandemic caused the deepest ever economic recession in the 27-nation bloc last year, hitting the south of the EU, where economies are often much more dependent on visitors, disproportionately hard.  With the rollout of vaccines against COVID-19 now gathering pace, some governments, like those of Greece and Spain, are pushing for a quick adoption of an EU-wide certificate for those already inoculated so that people can travel again. #https://news.yahoo.com/eu-eyes-vaccination-passports-resurrect-163112386.html#9Y8eOh0J5

S.  housing rally. The company posted adjusted revenue that beat estimates.  And with a ten-fold increase in net income last year to $9. 4 billion, Rocket declared a special dividend of $1. 11 per share, according to a statement on Thursday.  Shares surged as much as 7. 8% to $21. 46 in late trading. “We successfully drove growth in every segment of our business,” Rocket Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner said in the statement. The pandemic real estate boom gave a major boost to the mortgage industry, which posted record loan volume and profits in 2020 as rates dipped to historic lows.  Much of that was thanks to the Federal Reserve, which kept a lid on borrowing costs and bought mortgage bonds as part of its bid to stimulate the economy. But profitability may have peaked.  Rocket reported a 4. 41% profit margin on newly originated loans last quarter, well above the company’s November estimate of 3. 8% to 4. 1%.  It told investors on Thursday to expect margins on new loans this quarter to be around 3. 6% to 3. 9%. Mortgage lenders have been warning investors in recent weeks that profitability won’t expand this year.  UWM Holdings Corp. , the parent company of United Wholesale Mortgage, said profits on new loans this quarter could fall by as much as one-third from last year’s fourth quarter. Mr.  Cooper Group Inc. , meanwhile, said this week that its gains on mortgage sales -- lenders generally sell the loans they originate -- will be roughly flat this quarter. Read more: In a Flash, U. S.  Yields Hit 1. 6%, Wreaking Havoc Across MarketsMortgage rates in the U. S.  rose this week to the highest level in six months, threatening to snuff out the mortgage rally.  And with Treasury yields ticking higher, borrowing costs could continue to climb. That could deter more Americans from seeking to refinance debt, while surging home prices are pushing ownership out of reach for many. Mortgage applications fell to a nine-month low last week, while pending home sales last month dropped to a six-month low.

The Reserve Bank of Australia waded in with more than $2 billion of unscheduled purchases, while Korea announced buying plans for the next few months.  Traders are waiting to see if Japan will act to stop its benchmark yield from breaking out of its target range. The deepening divide between traders and central banks over the pace of the economic recovery looks set to lead to days of showdown, where policymakers seek to retain control over borrowing costs.  The rapid repricing of the reflation trade is rippling through all markets, putting pressure on valuations and hurting government debt auctions. “Reflation now needs a rein, and central banks are fighting the sharp rise in yields,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd.  in Singapore.  “Their credibility is at stake here too -- if they want to maintain accommodative policy they have to act if markets look like they’re running away. ”Read More: In a Flash, U. S.  Yields Hit 1. 6%, Wreaking Havoc Across MarketsThe RBA is taking the lead this time in acting as a breakwater for rising yields, a role typically played by the Bank of Japan in Asia.  Its offer to buy A$3 billion ($2. 4 billion) of debt acted to cap the selloff, with Australia’s three-year bond yield erasing gains.  Treasury yields also came down from the 1. 6% highs reached Thursday night as Asian investors piled in. While the BOJ hasn’t acted yet, Finance Minister Taro Aso fired a warning shot as the benchmark yield surged to within a couple of basis points of the perceived tolerance limit of the central bank.  “It’s important that yields don’t suddenly jump up and down,” said Aso in Tokyo.  “We need to make sure not to lose the market’s trust with fiscal management. ”Read: BOJ’s Tolerance for Rising Yields Tested Before Policy ReviewThe carnage for emerging-markets though continues unabated. Yields on Indonesian bonds -- a bellwether for EM sentiment -- surged to levels last seen in October while Bank Indonesia said it will be in the market to guard against a currency sinking fast.  The Bank of Korea, which has been restrained in debt purchases, said it will spend up to 7 trillion won ($6. 2 billion) to buy bonds in the first half, signaling that it sees a prolonged battle. While markets are increasingly pricing in higher inflation and the potential for rate hikes, every major central bank from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank to the RBA see a prolonged period of easing as economies gradually recover. There are expectations that global central banks will try to contain a further rise in yields, said Kei Yamazaki, a senior fund manager in Tokyo at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.  “Fed officials have been tolerating the recent rise in yields, but the current risk-averse market will also prompt them to calm the market verbally. ”Read: Convexity Hedging Haunts Markets Already Reeling From Bond RoutBond market snapshot:Treasury 10-year yields down six basis points to 1. 46%Australia’s 3-year yield fell one basis point to 0. 12%10-year JGB surged to 0. 175%, a level last seen before the BOJ announced negative interest rates in January 2016Indonesia’s benchmark yields are up 12 basis points to 6. 68%Spreads on high-grade dollar notes from Asian issuers widened about 3 basis points, the most since April last year. Stocks in Asia witnessed a broad selloff.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped as much as 2. 5%, the most since June, with technology shares being the worst performers.  Equity benchmarks in South Korea, China, Taiwan and Japan plunged more than 2% each. The over-riding question for many investors is the extent of the selloff -- many on Wall Street didn’t foresee Treasury yields crossing 1. 5% so quickly -- as each bout triggers stop-losses and lures short-sellers. Read: Emerging Markets Brace for Capital Flight in Fear of 2013 Rerun“Selling begets more selling,” said John Pearce, chief investment officer of UniSuper Management Pty.  in Sydney.  “In the short-term it doesn’t look like it’s stopping. ”For governments, it’s also starting to affect their ability to raise money, with even the U. S.  seeing record low demand at its Thursday debt auction.  Indonesia has already said it could pare back sales. “At a minimum, this pace of YCC needs to continue next week and I think the market’s looking for even more,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.  “They want to see that the RBA’s prepared to defend its target and to ensure financial conditions don’t tighten. ”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this release for the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures presented and a reconciliation of these measures to their closest comparable GAAP measures.  Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, ""I am proud of our 2020 achievements in light of the significant challenges we faced, primarily in our foodservice channel, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the full year, we grew total net revenues 37%, with sales to retail customers more than doubling versus the prior year. "" Brown added, ""Although weakened foodservice demand resulting from the global pandemic has impacted our near-term profitability, we continue to press forward with strategic investments in service of our future growth, including the build out of our production facilities in China and Europe, bolstering our research and development capabilities, amplifying our marketing voice, upgrading our IT infrastructure, and, importantly, continuing to build out talented teams across the globe to bring our ambitious goals to fruition.  Given our view that we are at a pivotal juncture, where we have an opportunity to transition from niche market to mainstream stature with bold, strategic actions, we will continue to invest aggressively in 2021 to accelerate our path towards this objective.  I truly believe that plant-based meat has reached a tipping point in terms of its cultural relevance and, critically, the fundamentals underpinning Beyond Meat's long-term prospects remain robust, with important brand metrics such as household penetration, buyer rates, purchase frequency and repeat rates all registering another quarter of uninterrupted growth.  My optimism about Beyond Meat's future therefore remains as solid as ever.  As we stay true to our guiding principle of providing consumers with great-tasting plant-based meats, made without the use of GMOs, bioengineered ingredients, hormones, antibiotics or cholesterol, we believe we are on a path to building an enduring global protein company that advances a more sustainable meat supply chain, consumer health and the health of our planet. "" Fourth Quarter 2020 Net revenues increased 3. 5% to $101. 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $98. 5 million in the prior year period.  Growth in net revenues was primarily due to increased retail channel sales, largely offset by a decline in foodservice channel sales due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on foodservice demand levels.  Growth in volume sold during the fourth quarter of 2020 was partially offset by lower net price per pound driven by the Company’s strategic investments in promotional activity, and product mix shifts as larger-pack items carrying a lower net price per unit volume accounted for a greater proportion of the Company's retail net revenues compared to the prior year period.

Adjusted gross profit, which excludes $3. 7 million of expenses attributable to COVID-19, was $29. 1 million, or Adjusted gross margin of 28. 5% of net revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to Adjusted gross profit of $33. 5 million, or Adjusted gross margin of 34. 0% of net revenues, in the prior year period.  The decrease in Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin was primarily due to lower absorption of fixed overhead production costs.  Specifically, recent curtailments of production volumes, mainly in the third quarter of 2020, resulted in the capitalization of higher fixed cost inventory in the third quarter, which was subsequently recognized as higher per unit cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the Company sold off inventory on hand.  In addition, to a lesser extent, Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin also decreased due to lower net price realization resulting from higher trade discounts as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and product mix shifts.  The $3. 7 million in expenses attributable to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of 2020 were driven by incremental inventory write-offs and reserves associated with foodservice products determined to be unsalable.  Loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $24. 5 million compared to loss from operations of $0. 9 million in the prior year period.  The increase in loss from operations was primarily driven by the decline in gross profit, combined with higher operating expenses primarily due to the Company’s increased headcount to support long-term growth, investment in international expansion efforts, specifically in Europe and China, higher production trial costs, investments in IT infrastructure, and continued investments in marketing and research and development.  Net loss was $25. 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net loss of $0. 5 million in the prior year period.  Net loss per common share was $0. 40 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net loss per common share of $0. 01 in the prior year period.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, net loss included $3. 7 million in expenses attributable to COVID-19, specifically related to inventory write-offs and reserves of certain foodservice products.  Excluding these costs, Adjusted net loss was $21. 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, or $0. 34 per common share, compared to Adjusted net loss of $0. 5 million, or $0. 01 per common share, in the prior year period.  Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $9. 5 million, or -9. 3% of net revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $9. 5 million, or 9. 7% of net revenues, in the prior year period.  Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson commented, “We emerged from a challenging year on firm footing and stand ready to capitalize on several opportunities ahead of us.  We believe our resolve to proceed with significant investments in our key strategic initiatives reinforces our long-term position, putting in place the necessary capabilities and infrastructure to support the long-term growth potential underpinned by our strengthening business fundamentals. ” Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $159. 1 million as of December 31, 2020 and total outstanding debt was $25. 0 million.  Net cash used in operating activities was $40. 0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $47. 0 million for the prior year.  Capital expenditures totaled $57. 7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $23. 8 million for the prior year.  The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by the Company’s continued investments in production equipment and facilities related to capacity expansion initiatives.  Separately, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in investing activities also included $15. 5 million of payments for asset acquisitions, specifically related to the Company's purchase of a former co-manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania.  Update on COVID-19 and 2021 Outlook Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to experience significantly reduced demand in its foodservice channel as decreased foot traffic, streamlined menu offerings and restrictions on foodservice locations’ operating capacity have resulted in closures or meaningfully curtailed operations of many of its foodservice customers.  At the same time, the surge in demand from retail customers that characterized the early stages of the pandemic as consumers abruptly shifted towards more at-home consumption has moderated.  Given that the ongoing evolution of consumer demand patterns across retail and foodservice channels has significantly increased the difficulty in forecasting the Company's customer demand levels, management will not be providing 2021 guidance until further notice.  Conference Call and Webcast The Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss these results with additional comments and details today at 5:00 p. m.  Eastern, 2:00 p. m.  Pacific.  Investors interested in participating in the live call can dial 270-215-9602.  The conference call webcast will be available live over the Internet through the “Investors” section of the Company’s website at www. beyondmeat. com and later archived.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful additional information to investors about current trends in the Company's operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of operations.  In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance and for business planning purposes.  Management also believes these measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of our operational performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.  Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin Adjusted gross profit is defined as net revenues less cost of goods sold adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to COVID-19 which are not considered to be part of the Company’s normal business activities.  Adjusted gross margin is defined as Adjusted gross profit divided by net revenues.  Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin are presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in the Company’s gross profit and gross margin, which we believe is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare the Company’s current business performance from one period to another.  Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share Adjusted net (loss) income is defined as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to COVID-19, as well as other special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company’s ongoing normal business activities.  Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share is defined as Adjusted net (loss) income divided by the number of diluted common shares outstanding.  We consider Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share to be indicators of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations.  Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring expenses, share-based compensation expense, expenses attributable to COVID-19, remeasurement of our warrant liability, and Other, net, including investment income, loss on extinguishment of debt and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.  Limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues rather than their most directly comparable GAAP measures.  Some of these limitations are: Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin exclude costs associated with activities deemed to be non-recurring or not part of the Company’s normal business activities, which are subjective determinations made by management and may not actualize as expected;Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share exclude costs associated with activities deemed to be non-recurring or not part of the Company’s normal business activities, which are subjective determinations made by management and may not actualize as expected;Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future increasing our cash requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring expenses that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect expenses attributable to COVID-19 that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect share-based compensation expense and therefore does not include all of our compensation costs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect Other, net, including investment income, loss on extinguishment of debt and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, that may increase or decrease cash available to us; andother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Expenses attributable to COVID-19 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include $1. 2 million in product donation costs related to the Company's COVID-19 relief efforts in the first quarter of 2020, which were not previously included in the Company's Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the three months ended March 28, 2020 as these were deemed immaterial to its first quarter 2020 financial results.  Given the significant increase in COVID-19-related expenses in the subsequent quarters of 2020, and to facilitate better comparison from period to period, management determined that it was appropriate to recast its previous first quarter 2020 Adjusted EBITDA calculation to include these costs. (3)Includes $1. 5 million in loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020. "#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-meat-reports-fourth-quarter-210500383.html#k3Y3SNJrC

2021-02-25 09:59:56#health#We’ve Gone Overboard Disinfecting Surfaces During COVID#https://news.yahoo.com/ve-gone-overboard-disinfecting-surfaces-095956819.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pNY.ZvAlIS.PDsITg0VArg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/fda4dbace30b17a840c07d7d2082c76e#en#0.0#news.yahoo.com#Ulises Ruiz/AFP via Getty A lot has happened over the past year, so you can be forgiven for not having a clear memory of what some of the major concerns were at the beginning of the pandemic. However, if you think back to the beginning of the pandemic, one of the major concerns was the role that surfaces played in the transmission of the virus. As an epidemiologist, I remember spending countless hours responding to media requests answering questions along the lines of whether we should be washing the outside of food cans or disinfecting our mail. I also remember seeing teams of people walking the streets at all hours wiping down poles and cleaning public benches. But what does the evidence actually say about surface transmission more than 12 months into this pandemic?Before addressing this, we need to define the question we’re asking.  The key question isn’t whether surface transmission is possible, or whether it can occur in the real world—it almost certainly can. The real question is: what is the extent of the role of surface contact in the transmission of the virus? That is, what is the likelihood of catching COVID via a surface, as opposed to other methods of transmission?There’s little evidence that surface transmission is a common way in which the coronavirus is spread.  The main way it’s spread is by the air, either by larger droplets via close contact, or by smaller droplets called aerosols.  As a side note, the relative role these two routes play in transmission is probably a much more interesting and important question to clarify from a public health perspective.  A member of the Hygiene Team sanitizes the doors at Rod Laver Arena during the 2021 Australian Open.  Mackenzie Sweetnam/Getty One of the best commentaries on COVID surface transmission was published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases in July 2020 by Emanuel Goldman, a professor of microbiology from the United States. As he described, one of the drivers for the exaggerated perception of the risk of surface transmission was the publication of a number of studies showing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles could be detected for long periods of time on various surfaces. You probably saw these studies because they received enormous publicity worldwide and I remember doing numerous interviews in which I had to explain what these findings actually meant. As I explained at the time, these studies could not be generalized to the real world, and in some instances the media releases accompanying them tended towards overstating the significance of these findings. The key issue is that as a general principle the time required for a population of microorganisms to die is directly proportional to the size of that population.  This means the greater the amount of virus deposited on a surface, the longer you will find viable viral particles on that surface. So in terms of designing experiments that are relevant to public health, one of the more important variables in these studies is the amount of virus deposited on a surface—and the extent to which this approximates what would happen in the real world. If you understand this, it becomes apparent that a number of these virus survival studies stacked the odds of detecting viable virus by depositing large amounts of virus on surfaces far in excess of what would be reasonably expected to be found in the real world.  What’s more, some of these studies customized conditions that would extend the life of viral particles, such as adjusting humidity and excluding natural light. Is Soap or Hand Sanitizer Best for Stopping Coronavirus?Although there was nothing wrong with the science here, it was the real world relevance and the interpretation that was amiss at times.  It’s notable that other studies which more closely replicated real world scenarios found less impressive survival times for three other human coronaviruses (including SARS). It’s important to note we’re relying on indirect evidence in assessing the role of surface transmission for the coronavirus.  That is, you can’t actually do an ethical scientific experiment that confirms the role surface transmission plays because you’d have to deliberately infect people.  Despite being such a seemingly straightforward question, it’s surprisingly difficult to determine the relative importance of the various transmission pathways for this virus. What we have to do instead is look at all of the evidence we do have and see what it’s telling us, including case studies describing transmission events.  And if we do this, there isn’t a lot out there to support surface transmission being of major importance in the spread of COVID. We need to put the risks of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via the various modes of transmission into perspective, so we focus our limited energy and resources on the right things. This isn’t to say surface transmission isn’t possible and that it doesn’t pose a risk in certain situations, or that we should disregard it completely.  But, we should acknowledge the threat surface transmission poses is relatively small. We can therefore mitigate this relatively small risk by continuing to focus on hand hygiene and ensuring cleaning protocols are more in keeping with the risk of surface transmission. In doing this, we can potentially save millions of dollars being spent on obsessive cleaning practices.  These are probably providing little or no benefit and being done solely because they’re easy to do and provide the reassurance of doing something, thereby relieving some of our anxieties.

Catalina Lauf, who served in the Department of Commerce under the Trump administration, launched a bid Thursday to oust Kinzinger from his seat in the 16th congressional district of Illinois.  “I never thought I’d primary a fellow Republican, but is Congressman Kinzinger really a Republican anymore? He isn’t and we have the proof,” the 27-year-old challenger said in a campaign announcement video.  Lauf said her 42-year-old opponent is a “weak-kneed, establishment Republican” who “cares more about his next MSNBC appearance than the voters who elected him. ” She claimed Kinzinger does not support the “America First” movement, noting his “one in three votes” in Congress that have sided with House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D. , Calif. ) “Instead of being in our fight, Adam betrayed his constituents for a life in the D. C.  swamp,” said Lauf, who branded herself the “anti-AOC. ” She blasts her “Fake Republican” opponent for backing the “phony impeachment hoax for a president who has already left office. ” “He said impeachment was ‘necessary to save America. ’ What?” Lauf said.  “You know what I think is necessary to save America, Adam? Setting term limits for people like you and the rest of your friends out.  Six terms in Congress is enough. ” Kinzinger is one of ten House Republicans who supported Trump’s impeachment on the charge of “incitement of insurrection” after a mob of the former president’s supporters stormed the U. S.  Capitol last month.  Others who supported impeachment, including Representative Liz Cheney (R. , Wyo. ) and Representative Anthony Gonzalez (R. , Ohio), are likely to face primary challenges from pro-Trump Republican candidates as well.  Gonzalez is expected to face a primary challenge from a former Trump aide, Max Miller, who served in the White House.  Miller has reportedly been in discussion with top Republican donors in Ohio and other Republican leaders since leaving the White House last month, according to Politico.  Miller, who is from northeastern Ohio, recently purchased a house in Rocky River, which is inside Gonzalez’s 16th district, according to the report.  As for Lauf, she says she will focus on a number of issues, if elected, including “social media censorship,” “election integrity,” “freedom of speech,” “gun rights,” “illegal immigration,” and “keeping the economy going. ” Lauf is the daughter of a Guatemalan immigrant mother and a small-business-owner father.  This marks Lauf’s second bid for Congress, having run in the 14th congressional district of Illinois in 2020.  State senator Jim Oberweis beat out Lauf in a crowded primary to become the GOP candidate, but ultimately lost in the general election against incumbent representative Lauren Underwood, a Democrat, by less than 2 percent. #https://news.yahoo.com/former-trump-aide-run-primary-133040029.html#PLU2m8W9x

When the retro game rescue crew at Nightdive first launched the Kickstarter campaign to remake System Shock in 2016, the studio ambitiously thought it could be finished in a year and a half.  That didn't happen, and early in 2018, the game far from done, they made the dramatic move of restarting from scratch, after straying too far from the original idea of a faithful remake. Three more years in, it's nearly finished: Pre-orders are available starting Thursday, and Nightdive's head of business development Larry Kuperman told me the launch isn't far off.  The plan is for System Shock to be out this summer.  A new demo, available for everyone to download today, represents a game that's finally almost at the finish line. The goal of the demo is to present a ""feature-complete version of the game,"" says CEO Stephen Kick, so players ""understand exactly what they'll be getting if they preorder. "" Kick walked me through what the demo includes that we haven't already seen from Nightdive's remake so far. ""Those features include a dismemberment system, so you'll be able to blow apart the mutants and cyborgs that are onboard Citadel Station,"" he said.  ""The lighting is now fully real-time so you'll be able to destroy the lights.  We wanted to make it as immersive as possible.  One of the other really big features that's available for the first time is cyberspace.  You can go into cyberspace, fight the various enemies that are there, and unlock doors that are in the real world that are protected by SHODAN in virtual reality. ""The demo also has new voice acting, more detailed environments, and dynamic music that will change out sections of a track rather than run on a loop.  It's more advanced than the original game's, and the new soundtrack will definitely have its own vibe, too. ""The original had a dynamic system that would change based on whether you were in combat or exploring.  We have that, we've recreated that, but the tone of the music has definitely changed,"" said Kick.  ""When you're exploring it's a lot more atmospheric, and not so much like you're in a '90s rave. ""But don't worry—parts of the System Shock remake's soundtrack will still be danceable.  Artist Evelyn Mansell pointed out that cyberspace is pretty ravey.

The average U. S.  price of regular-grade gasoline jumped 14 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $2. 64, according to the Associated Press.  The price at the pump has climbed 46 cents since Nov.  20.  Some of the rise this past week was attributable to the deep freeze in the South, which temporarily shut down production at about a dozen refineries in and around Texas.  Resumption of production there could bring some temporary relief, but the long-term outlook is not as rosy. #https://fox8.com/news/analysts-say-gas-prices-of-3-per-gallon-is-real-possibility/#UcWgxytTf

AP Photo/Evan VucciThe Biden administration and Congress are fast-tracking a US$1. 9 trillion coronavirus package that includes aid for states, cities, individuals, the unemployed, schools and much else.  It could become law within weeks.  But is it stimulus or relief? If you’ve been reading stories on the legislation, you’ll frequently see it called one or the other – or sometimes both.  The White House calls it a “rescue plan,” while an economist might dryly refer to it as a “fiscal” package.  What does it matter? As a macroeconomist who focuses on growth, I would argue it both matters – and it doesn’t.  On one level it’s semantics, or politics, but there’s also a fundamental question about what really ails the economy – and what the right remedy is.  It’s a relief A macroeconomy – that is, the overall economy, not individual businesses or industries – is made of two basic components: aggregate supply and aggregate demand.  Aggregate supply represents the quantity of goods and services an economy can produce, while aggregate demand represents how much consumers and businesses are willing to spend on those products.  When an economic crisis strikes, the problem is usually considered one or the other: Either the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services has been curtailed, or something reduced the willingness of consumers and businesses to buy stuff.  More rarely, it can also be both.  Economists consider a relief package the right solution when the crisis affects primarily supply.  When much of the U. S.  economy shut down a year ago, for example, the pandemic recession felt very much like a so-called supply shock, as many businesses had to close their doors and stop providing goods and services.  So economists and policymakers assumed the economy’s primary need was aid to tide over companies and workers until the crisis passed.  That’s why the 2020 coronavirus bills were generally seen as aimed at providing relief – in the form of supplemental unemployment benefits, individual checks and grants to small businesses to keep workers on their payroll – not stimulus.  The Associated Press style guide, effectively a bible for journalists about word usage, explicitly advises reporters covering March’s $2. 2 trillion coronavirus relief bill: “Do not refer to it as a stimulus.  … The measure was passed to replace money lost in the collapse of the economy, rather than to stimulate demand. ” So if the economy’s underlying problems concern supply, the main goal is to shore up industries, businesses and individuals most affected until they can get back to work, which, most people at first assumed, was just a matter of time.  The Paycheck Protection Program, which gave forgivable loans to businesses affected by COVID-19 lockdowns last year, is a good example of this approach.  Or is it stimulating A stimulus, as the name implies, is meant to stimulate the macroeconomy.  It begins with the assumption that what ails the economy is a lack of demand for goods and services.  The idea, first proposed by British economist John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression, is that an economy is unlikely to recover on its own unless the government jump-starts spending, stimulating consumer and business demand.  One recent example of government stimulus is the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in 2009 during the Great Recession.  Economists broadly consider it stimulus, and it was split between tax cuts, spending on unemployment and education, and infrastructure investment.  A stimulus bill, first and foremost, is meant to get consumers to spend and businesses to invest.  It can accomplish this by cutting taxes, injecting money into the economy or investing in what were referred to in 2009 as “shovel-ready” infrastructure projects.  Depends on the crisis So that raises the question, what kind of economic crisis are we in now? To some extent, it’s delivered a shock to both supply and demand and has affected different parts of the economy in very divergent ways.  Some companies, like Amazon, are doing great, while others, such as airlines and hotels, are doing terribly.  And employees with professional jobs who can work from home over Zoom are doing fine, while many lower-paid service workers are among the hardest hit.  January’s jobs report shows the dual track.  The main unemployment rate fell to 6. 3%, significantly down from 14. 8% last April.  At the same time, the number of unemployed describing their job loss as “permanent” is declining more slowly and remains three times its pre-pandemic level.  And the number of long-term unemployed has been increasing.  Moreover, the 6. 3% headline rate measures only people actively looking for work and leaves out millions of Americans who have given up looking for work or are underemployed.  Taken together, these numbers indicate that a large number of people are not expecting to get back to work anytime soon and will need more than just a little help to tide them over.  This situation makes the case for a large, broad-based package – something like the Biden proposal – that both provides relief but also stimulus to create the demand for new jobs and to draw the long-term unemployed back into the job market.  Some have grown alarmed about the amount of money the government will spend, however, and worry that it’ll stimulate too much and spur inflation.  Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, for example, says the so-called output gap – the difference between what the U. S.  economy is currently producing and what it is capable of producing – isn’t all that big, which could mean the size of Biden’s package will drive up prices without really generating new economic activity.  [Deep knowledge, daily.  Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter. ] You say potato, I say stimulus To some extent, these definitions may be distinctions without a difference.  Even a narrowly tailored relief package would have some stimulative effect on the economy.  All those “economic impact” checks the government sent out in 2020 were meant as relief, but they had a significant stimulating impact as well.  To the extent that a program gets people spending more, it is a stimulus.  To the extent that the same program leads to job creation for the unemployed, it is a relief package.  Ultimately, the word matters less than the impact.  And economists in the White House, Federal Reserve and academia like me will be tracking it closely.

When exactly those films arrive has yet to be determined, as the COVID-19 pandemic has repeatedly pushed back the release slates of dozens of blockbusters.  But for now, “A Quiet Place II,” which was originally set for release in March 2020, is set for release in theaters on September 17, while “MI7” is set for release in theaters on Nov.  19.  Paramount’s announcement comes as the pandemic has led Hollywood studios to experiment with the theatrical window that has been fiercely defended by movie theaters for decades.  Universal Pictures has signed a deal with AMC Theaters and Cinemark to release its films on PVOD as early as 17 days after theatrical release, or 31 days if the film grosses more than $50 million in its opening weekend.  Also Read: Here's Everything ViacomCBS Just Announced Is Coming to Paramount+ Warner Bros. , meanwhile, made the controversial decision to release all of its 2021 films on HBO Max for 30 days at the same time they are release in theaters.  Disney is also experimenting with the theatrical window, placing its animated film “Raya and the Last Dragon” in both theaters and on PVOD for Disney+ subscribers on March 5.  Paramount has sold distribution rights to several streaming services over the course of the pandemic, including Aaron Sorkin’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7” to Netflix and Eddie Murphy’s “Coming 2 America” to Amazon Studios.  But the studio has held on to its biggest tentpoles, delaying them in the hopes that theaters will be able to reopen this fall and allow the films to earn a strong return at the box office.  Combined, “A Quiet Place” and “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” grossed over $1. 1 billion worldwide during a resurgent box office year for Paramount in 2018, and the sequels, along with “Top Gun: Maverick” are part of the studio’s plan to rebound after struggles in 2019 and 2020.

The revenue for these support contracts is deferred and typically recognized over a period of time after the Coriant acquisition, so Infinera's GAAP revenue for a period of time after the acquisition will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value.  The non-GAAP adjustment eliminates the effect of the deferred revenue write-down.  Management believes these adjustments to revenue from support contracts assumed in the Coriant acquisition are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue trends in Infinera's business.  (2)Other customer-related charges include one-time benefits and charges that are not directly related to Infinera’s ongoing or core business results.  During the second quarter of 2019, Infinera agreed to reimburse a customer for certain expenses incurred by them in connection with a network service outage that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.  Management has excluded the impact of this charge in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring, and management believes that this reimbursement is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.  (3)Stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation effective January 1, 2006.  The following table summarizes the effects of stock-based compensation related to employees and non-employees (in thousands): Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December26, 2020 September26, 2020 December28, 2019 December26, 2020 December28, 2019Cost of revenue $1,742 $1,878 $1,752 $7,785 $6,449 Total Cost of revenue 1,742 1,878 1,752 7,785 6,449 Research and development 4,501 4,209 3,574 16,863 17,457 Sales and marketing 2,771 2,706 2,578 10,907 8,413 General and administration 3,905 3,270 3,169 13,906 10,460 Total Operating expenses $11,177 $10,185 $9,321 $41,676 $36,330 Total stock-based compensation expense $12,919 $12,063 $11,073 $49,461 $42,779 (4)Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of developed technology, trade names, customer relationships and backlog acquired in connection with the Coriant acquisition.  Amortization of acquired intangible assets also consists of amortization of developed technology, trade names and customer relationships acquired in connection with the Transmode AB acquisition.  U. S.  GAAP accounting requires that acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives.  As this amortization is non-cash, Infinera has excluded it from its non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses and net income measures.  Management believes the amortization of acquired intangible assets is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (5)Acquisition and integration costs consist of legal, financial, IT, manufacturing-related costs, employee-related costs and professional fees incurred in connection with the Coriant acquisition.  These amounts have been adjusted in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that these expenses are non-recurring, not indicative of ongoing operating performance and their exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (6)Business combination accounting principles require Infinera to measure acquired inventory at fair value.  The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’s cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin.  The non-GAAP adjustment to Infinera's cost of sales excludes the amortization of the acquisition-related step-up in carrying value for units sold in the quarter.  Additionally, in connection with the Coriant acquisition, cost of sales excludes a one-time adjustment in inventory as a result of renegotiated supplier agreements that contained unusually higher than market pricing.  Management believes these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect ongoing cost of sales and gross margin trends of Infinera's business.  (7)Restructuring and related costs are primarily associated with the reduction of operating costs, the closure of Infinera's Berlin, Germany site, the reduction of headcount at Infinera's Munich, Germany site and other sites, and Coriant's historical restructuring plan associated with its early retirement plan.  In addition, this includes accelerated amortization on operating lease right-of-use assets due to the cessation of use of certain facilities.  Management has excluded the impact of these charges in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results as they are non-recurring in nature and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (8)COVID-19 related costs consist of higher replacement costs associated with certain warranty parts customers were unable to return for repair due to logistics issues and mobility issues related to COVID-19 public health mandates and restrictions.  In addition, Infinera needed to source certain key components from an alternate supplier at substantially higher cost in order to fulfill delivery commitments in the normal course of business.  Management has excluded these expenses from non-GAAP financial measures because they were caused by atypical circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic, as their exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (9)Litigation charges are associated with the preliminary settlement of a litigation matter agreed to during the quarter ended June 29, 2019.  Management has excluded the impact of this charge in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring and management believes that this expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.  (10)Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's non-convertible debt borrowing rate.  Accordingly, for GAAP purposes, Infinera is required to amortize as debt discount an amount equal to the fair value of the conversion option that was recorded in equity as interest expense on the $402. 5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2. 125% convertible debt issuance in September 2018 due September 2024 and $200 million in aggregate principal amount of 2. 50% convertible debt issued in March 9, 2020 due March 2027.  Interest expense has been excluded from Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.  (11)Management has excluded the gain on the sale related to non-marketable equity investments in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring, and management believes that this income is not indicative of ongoing operating performance (12)The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is due to the net tax effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.  (13)Non-GAAP EPS as adjusted did not exclude the impact of foreign currency.  Had the impact of foreign currency been excluded for the three months ended December 26, 2020, September 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, non-GAAP EPS as adjusted would have been $0. 08, loss of less than one cent, and $0. 02, respectively, and for the twelve months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, non-GAAP EPS as adjusted would have been $(0. 19) and $(0. 57), respectively.  (14)The non-GAAP diluted shares include the potentially dilutive securities from Infinera's stock-based benefit plans excluded from the computation of dilutive net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  These potentially dilutive securities are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when Infinera has net income on a non-GAAP basis.  During the three months ended December 26, 2020, the Company included the dilutive effects of the 2027 Notes in the calculation of diluted net income per common share as the average market price was above the conversion price of the Notes.  The dilutive impact of the Notes was based on the difference between the Company's average stock price during the period and the conversion price of the Notes.

WFAM is the asset management unit of the bank, with $603 billion in assets under management and specialized investment teams with more than 450 investment professionals.  The deal is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021.  Per the terms of the transaction, Wells Fargo (WFC) will continue to serve as a client and distribution partner, holding a 9. 9% equity interest.  Wells Fargo’s Wealth & Investment Management division CEO Barry Sommers said, “Operating as an independent firm as a portfolio company of GTCR and Reverence Capital will provide numerous benefits to WFAM’s clients, employees, and strategic partners — including Wells Fargo. ” (See Wells Fargo stock analysis on TipRanks) “At the same time, this transaction reflects Wells Fargo’s strategy to focus on businesses that serve our core consumer and corporate clients, and will allow us to focus even more on growing our wealth and brokerage businesses,” he added.  On Feb. 18, J. P.  Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja upgraded the stock to Hold from Sell and increased the price target to $37 from $31. 50 following “news reports that the Federal Reserve accepted the company’s plan to overhaul its risk management and compliance, which is a critical step on the path to eventual lifting of the asset cap. ” Juneja believes the company’s “valuation is appropriate after factoring in potential earnings benefit from lifting of the asset cap plus sizable cost savings from its restructuring. ” However, the analyst said, “there is still much uncertainty about the full earnings run rate and profitability once the restructuring is completed. ” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating.  That’s based on 11 analysts suggesting a Buy and 8 analysts recommending a Hold.  The average analyst price target of $36. 63 implies 1% downside potential to current levels.

2021-02-23 21:55:09#tech#The development of Dying Light 2 has been 'total chaos,' according to report#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-development-of-dying-light-2-has-been-total-chaos-according-to-report/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qR99xjfDtqMDwMzzmUtXA5-1200-80.jpg#en#0.0#www.pcgamer.com#"Dying Light 2 has had its share of struggles since it was announced almost three years ago at E3 2018.  Developer Techland made some very big promises regarding the impact of individual player choice on gameplay and outcomes, which would demand multiple playthroughs for anyone who wanted to see more than half of the content it offered.  But a planned release for spring 2020 was missed, and a new release date hasn't been set.  The game also lost its lead writer, Pawel Selinger, who departed earlier this year after more than 20 years at the studio. A new report on Techland published by TheGamer suggests that the project may be floundering largely due to problems at the studio, particularly regarding the ""autocratic"" management style of CEO Pawel Marchewka.  Interviews with ten current and former employees allege problems including an over-reliance on external consultants who lack experience in the games industry (whose advice is often ignored anyway), conflict at the production level, a high rate of staff turnover, and micromanagement that some developers characterized as ""the eye of Sauron,"" which has collectively had the effect of stripping the game of a ""coherent vision. ""Techland has a history of hiring people for which the team had 'high hopes,' but it ended up in nothing,"" one source said.  ""One such case for the designers was the hiring of Marc Albinet, a former game director from Ubisoft, that was supposed to restructure how design is done in the studio.  Even he, a veteran with 30 years of experience, couldn't break through upper management that is harder to change than the spin of the fucking Earth. ""New hires and consultant who don't follow the company line end up sidelined, according to another source, which ultimately leads to their resignation or termination: ""To make a career at Techland, you have to be subservient. ""Techland's insistence on using its own internal technology to power the game is also a stumbling block, according to some employees.  Dying Light uses the Chrome Engine, a proprietary 3D engine developed by Techland, but after the first game was released the chief development officer at the time, Pawel Zawodny, wanted development of the sequel to be iterated in a more widely used engine, like Unreal or Unity, before bringing their work to the Chrome Engine.  Marchewka, however, insisted on everything being done in Chrome Engine 6. ""It slowed everyone down and that frustrated everyone,"" a source told TheGamer.  ""He would ask why people aren't working faster and it was because the tech isn’t up to speed.  We can work faster, but we have to go here, and you're not allowing us to go there.  The experts know what the goal is, and they should be allowed the flexibility to do what’s best. ""Zawodny, who now heads up CD Projekt Red's Wroclaw studio, brought on consultants of his own to help build a more conventional workflow, but many of their suggestions were apparently not adopted.  The system as it currently stands, one employee told TheGamer, is ""a production pipeline that changes so quickly and rapidly that it might as well not exist. "" More producers have been hired to help get the wheels turning, but reportedly often find their efforts blocked be veteran employees. The report touches on a range of other issues, such as producers interfering in design decisions—one source said producers on Dying Light 2 ""cannot hold the pipeline or milestones together, but they [have] time to redesign or argue about design""—and constant micromanagement from upper management, which collectively points to an atmosphere of chaos and aimlessness at the studio, and on Dying Light 2. ""What is going on in Techland is just total chaos, not iteration,"" a source said.  ""There are plenty of examples where there is someone responsible for a given feature—like a game director decides on something—but Pyza [creative director Adrian 'Pyza' Ciszewski] and Marchewka just overwrite this because of some bullshit reason, like they've seen something working differently in other games so we can do it like that. ""Marchewka defended the studio and its processes, saying that ""trust and the flow of ideas in a large organization is a complex issue. ""We are currently working on creating an innovative game that millions of players around the world will love, and thus we are constantly looking for methods that allow us to improve the transmission of fresh and interesting ideas,"" he said.  ""However, not every idea is a good idea for this project, and only the best and consistent ones with the vision of the project will be implemented in our game. ”Unfortunately, there's still no sign of a Dying Light 2 release date: Techland said in January when it confirmed Selinger's departure that it would ""be sharing exciting news about Dying Light 2 soon,"" but as of now there's been no sign of what that news might be.  I've reached out to Techland for comment, and will update if I receive a reply. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-development-of-dying-light-2-has-been-total-chaos-according-to-report/#BXodmttyB

The novel comes out Oct.  12, and will be jointly released by Clinton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, and Penny's, St.  Martin's Press. #https://news.yahoo.com/hillary-clinton-louise-penny-co-135236322.html#QfytIy60H

This could see the machines fail in less than two years, if the numbers are correct, and while this really is a worst-case scenario, it still paints a worrying picture about the longevity of the new machines.  Something compounded by the fact that the SSDs are soldered on the mainboards, which means replacing them isn't straightforward. Core to what's going on is the way in which SSDs work, specifically the number of writes they can reliably support.  The flash memory on the drives can only be written to a certain number of times before becoming unstable.  There are plenty of systems in place to spread the load across all the memory cells, but essentially there's a point where the drive has been written to so many times that it can no longer reliably hold the information. This is all summed up by the Total Bytes Written figure, measured in terabytes (which is why it's also referred to as Terabytes Written).  This needs to be considered in the context of the length of the warranty, which is generally five years. #https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-m1-macs-appear-to-be-chewing-through-their-ssds/#noV94HdfR
