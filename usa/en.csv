By the end of December, Bolivia clinched its first major deal, with enough shots for some 20 percent of the population. The first Sputnik V doses arrived in the country in late January, just as cases were spiking, bringing hope to one of Latin America’s most ravaged nations where a recent surge has left corpses piling up amid overwhelmed funeral homes and cemeteries.  Bolivian President Luis Arce:PRESIDENT ARCE ON JAN 28, 2021: ""Today the Bolivian people can breathe easy, they can start to do so little-by-little and gradually…” Bolivia's reliance on Moscow underscores how governments across the region have turned to Russia's Sputnik V drug amid fears of being left behind in the global scramble for vaccines.  While wealthier developed nations have signed deals with large drug makers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca – many Latin America countries have faced difficulties doing so.  Bolivian deputy trade minister Benjamin Blanco called discussions last year to obtain AstraZeneca’s vaccine as “difficult” and “intense,” though he declined to give more details, citing a confidentiality agreement.  Bolivia wasn’t able to negotiate with Pfizer, he said, because the country lacked the infrastructure to store the vaccines at the freezing temperatures required.  But Russia's political will made a deal possible, Blanco said. “Thanks to the relationship that we have at the political level, Russia considers Bolivia a strategic partner and vice versa, thanks to the intervention of our own Bolivian president, who has contacted the president of Russia by phone, this contract was achieved. ""For Russia, acceptance in Latin America lends legitimacy to its vaccine, which faced initial skepticism.  It also provides Moscow an opportunity to make in-roads in the resource rich region at a time when COVID-19 vaccines are becoming a tool for soft power.  Sputnik V is named after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race, in a nod to the project’s geopolitical importance for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Five other Latin American countries have now authorized use of the Sputnik V, including Argentina, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Venezuela.

Benedict, now 93, in 2013 became the first pope in more than 600 years to resign instead of ruling for life, saying he no longer had the strength to govern the 1. 3 billion-member Church.  Some hardline conservatives unhappy with the more liberal Pope Francis have often voiced doubts about whether Benedict stepped down willingly, even though he has said several times in the past eight years that he did.

This makes the “connection to abortion … extremely remote,” in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, the statement argues, recommending that Catholics choose one of those instead, if provided a choice.  While the archdiocese claims the decision is in line with guidance from the Vatican, the U. S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Catholic Bioethics Center, none of the three have issued statements denouncing the new vaccine.  In December, the Vatican issued general guidelines regarding vaccines in which the Holy See said it was “morally acceptable” for Catholics to receive shots that used the HEK293 cells for research.  While the HEK293 cells are reportedly originated from an aborted fetus from the 1970s, ethicists have said that the cells and similar cell lines are clones and not the original fetal tissue.  The Vatican has made the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available for all Vatican City residents.  Pope Francis reportedly received the shot in January.  The Archdiocese of New Orleans’ statement comes after leaders of the USCCB and leaders from other religious organizations sent a letter to the commissioner of the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration last spring regarding ethical concerns over the COVID-19 vaccines.  “We are aware that, among the dozens of vaccines currently in development, some are being produced using old cell lines that were created from the cells of aborted babies,” the letter read.  “For example, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  has a substantial contract from the U. S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is working on a vaccine that is being produced using one of these ethically problematic cell lines. ” However, a USCCB memo written by Bishop Kevin C.  Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, who chairs the USCCB’s Committee on Doctrine, and Archbishop Joseph F.  Naumann of Kansas City, who chairs the organization’s Committee on Pro-Life Activities, argued that the vaccines are moral. #https://news.yahoo.com/orleans-archdiocese-asks-catholics-avoid-204653911.html#GbuuBwgPF

Gary Gensler, whom the White House has tapped to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Rohit Chopra, the administration’s choice to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are likely to win confirmation, lawmakers and financial executives say.  Yet their strong support from progressive Democrats means they’re certain to get pointed questions from Republican senators about their plans to crack down on businesses. The wild rally in GameStop Corp. , the explosion of blank-check companies and apps -- like Robinhood Markets’ platform -- that have prompted millions of novice investors to start trading are sure to be focuses.  The biggest banks, hedge funds and private equity firms are also likely to be spotlighted, particularly after four years of rule cutting under former President Donald Trump. Gensler, 63, is well known on Wall Street after leading the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration and making a fortune decades earlier at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Chopra, a 39-year-old Federal Trade Commission member who helped Senator Elizabeth Warren set up the CFPB, would run an agency that Democrats want reinvigorated to protect consumers from abuses involving credit cards, mortgages and high-interest loans.  Republicans would prefer it remain in the slumber that defined the bureau in the Trump era. “There remains a sharp divide between Republicans and Democrats on the role of the CFPB in financial regulation,” said Andrew Olmem, National Economic Council deputy director in the Trump administration who is now a partner at the Mayer Brown law firm.  “This is a very important nomination because a new director can significantly shift the direction of the CFPB. ”Gensler, who has been been teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, indicated in his prepared testimony that he planned to examine whether SEC rules have kept pace with advancements in technology.  “I believe financial technology can be a powerful force for good -- but only if we continue to harness the core values of the SEC in service of investors, issuers, and the public,” he said. Chopra signaled he would focus on the economic impact of coronavirus, which he said has left millions of Americans’ finances “in ruin. ” “Experts expect distress across a number of consumer credit markets, including an avalanche of loan defaults and auto repossessions,” he said. What follows is a breakdown of policy topics that Gensler and Chopra will confront at the hearing -- and, if confirmed, in their jobs:Retail InvestorsThe popularity of commission-free trading -- spearheaded by Robinhood -- has forced regulators to grapple with new questions.  Top among them is “gamification” and the proliferation of apps that make investing fun but that critics claim inappropriately hook consumers with nudges and prompts to keep them trading.  Determining whether and how to respond is something Gensler will have to grapple with.  The issue could also fall under the purview of Chopra and the CFPB. The GameStop frenzy has prompted additional regulatory concerns, including whether unsophisticated investors should be able to so freely engage in risky trading involving options.  Bubbles, too, will be on senators’ minds.  A number think the SEC should do something about the eye-popping rise of unregulated Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Another potential target is special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACS, which are essentially corporate shells that issue shares before investors even know what their money is being used for. Market StructureThe GameStop saga has made lawmakers wake up to the inner-workings of the stock market.  Practices like off-exchange trading and Robinhood and other brokers selling their customers’ orders to so-called market makers like Citadel Securities are getting unprecedented attention on Capitol Hill. Short-selling has also come under fire after it emerged that hedge funds making bearish bets had borrowed more than 100% of GameStop’s outstanding shares.  In the face of all that complexity, lawmakers will want to know how Gensler plans to ensure that markets are fair for average Americans. Private EquityAmong the Banking Committee Democrats who have most relished going after private equity are Chairman Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Warren of Massachusetts. Warren introduced the “Stop Wall Street Looting Act” in 2019 calling for new rules for buyout firms, and she made the industry’s treatment of workers a centerpiece of her unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign.  She and Brown have said they will continue to press the issue and have ideas for how Gensler can use the SEC to add new oversight.  Giving impetus to their plans is a successful push by private-equity firms during the Trump administration to be included as an investment option in corporate retirement saving plans. EnforcementWall Street could soon find itself subject to lots more investigations launched by the CFPB, which was created to crack down on industry abuses that Democrats argue spurred the 2008 financial crisis.  Beyond big banks, the agency under Chopra may also focus on payday lenders, student loan providers and on issues tied to the retail trading boom. At the SEC, wielding the agency’s powers to probe and sanction companies is where Gensler can make his biggest impact.  A high-profile case against a major bank or hedge fund can ripple through the finance industry, deterring other firms from engaging in similar conduct.  During the Trump era, busting Wall Street titans was rarely a priority, something progressives expect Gensler to change quickly. CryptoBitcoin has skyrocketed more than 400% in the past year and Coinbase, a trading platform used by millions American, is on the cusp of one of the biggest initial public offerings in years.  Yet, despite all the buzz, cryptocurrencies are still a big question mark for Wall Street.  Industry backers say that an impediment to broad adoption is a clear legal framework and a lack of regulatory clarity from the SEC. It’ll probably fall largely on Gensler to determine how to regulate the industry.  Thorny topics he will likely have to deal with include whether to approve a crypto based exchange-traded fund, and how aggressively to pursue a high-profile lawsuit the SEC filed last year against Ripple Labs Inc.  for allegedly misleading investors by selling more than $1 billion of virtual tokens without registering them with the regulator. Climate ChangeProgressives want Biden’s financial regulators to play a crucial role in addressing climate change, including by pressing companies to reveal more about how global warming affects their bottom lines.  Democrats also want industry watchdogs to combat inequality by implementing policies that narrow social and economic gaps. At Tuesday’s hearing, such objectives are expected to get lots of attention from Republicans, who argue that securities laws and corporate disclosures should not be used to push what they consider to be political agendas.

ET BUFFALO, N. Y. , March 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athenex, Inc. , (NASDAQ: ATNX), a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer and related conditions, today announced that the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for oral paclitaxel plus encequidar for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  The FDA issues a CRL to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form.  In the CRL, the FDA indicated its concern of safety risk to patients in terms of an increase in neutropenia-related sequelae on the Oral Paclitaxel arm compared with the IV paclitaxel arm.  The FDA also expressed concerns regarding the uncertainty over the results of the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) at week 19 conducted by blinded independent central review (BICR).  The Agency stated that the BICR reconciliation and re-read process may have introduced unmeasured bias and influence on the BICR.  The agency recommended that Athenex conduct a new adequate and well-conducted clinical trial in a patient population with metastatic breast cancer representative of the population in the U. S.  The Agency determined that additional risk mitigation strategies to improve toxicity, which may involve dose optimization and / or exclusion of patients deemed to be at higher risk of toxicity, are required to support potential approval of the NDA.  Athenex plans to request a meeting with the FDA to discuss the Agency’s response, engage in a dialogue on the design and scope of a clinical trial to address the FDA’s requirements and align on the next steps required to obtain approval.  “Our clinical and regulatory teams are disappointed by the complete response letter,” said Dr.  Rudolf Kwan, Chief Medical Officer of Athenex.  “We plan to work with the Agency to resolve the issues raised in the CRL and to obtain approval for oral paclitaxel plus encequidar in metastatic breast cancer. ” Dr.  Johnson Lau, Chief Executive Officer of Athenex, added, “We remain committed to the breast cancer community and will explore the best path forward to obtain regulatory approval.  In the interim, we will identify and undertake the appropriate internal organizational adjustments accordingly. ” Webcast and Conference Call Athenex will host a webcast and conference call today Monday, March 1, 2021, at 8 a. m.

The autonomous region, a favorite among the industry because of its cheap power, also banned new digital coin projects, according to a draft plan posted on the Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission’s website Feb.  25.  The aim is to constrain growth in energy consumption to about 1. 9% in 2021. Bitcoin extended gains on Monday amid reports of the move, increasing as much as 6% in the session to $47,970. The announcement unnerved an industry that’s already been through a years-long Chinese campaign to clamp down amid concerns over speculative bubbles, fraud and energy waste.  The draft policy was released weeks after China’s top economic planner blasted Inner Mongolia for being the only province to fail to control energy consumption in 2019. The region now aims to cut emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 3% this year and limit incremental growth of energy consumption to about 5 million tons of standard coal, according to the draft plan. Chinese officials first outlined proposals in 2018 to discourage crypto-mining -- the computing process that makes transactions with virtual currencies possible but consumes vast amounts of power. Inner Mongolia, which is clustered with large coal mines, is famous for inexpensive energy and has attracted investment from a plethora of power-intensive sectors such as aluminum and ferro-alloy smelting over past decades.  The region accounted for 8% of global Bitcoin mining computing power, according to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index compiled by Cambridge University.  China overall had over 65% of the network’s total, with its appealing combination of inexpensive electricity, local chipmaking factories and cheap labor. The local crackdown is reviving old fears.  Beijing since 2017 has abolished initial coin offerings and clamped down on virtual currency trading within its borders, forcing many exchanges overseas.  The country was once home to about 90% of trades but the lion’s share of mining and major players like Bitmain Technologies Ltd.  have since fled abroad. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  and Nvidia Corp.  are among listed chipmakers that supply crypto miners in China and around the world.

This camera is mounted on the bottom of the descent stage and looks at the rover.  This image was acquired on February 22, 2021 (Sol 1) at the local mean solar time of 10:37:31.  A key objective for Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life.  The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, paving the way for human exploration of the Red Planet and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith.
