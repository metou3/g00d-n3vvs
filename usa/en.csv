House Democrats voted to boot her from her committee assignments in an act that they will surely come to regret, perhaps as soon as January 2023.  If the majority can keep members of the opposition party off of committees based on incendiary comments, it’s not clear why the GOP ever let, say, Maxine Waters serve on any committees when it had control of the chamber, or why it ever will again.  Kicking off Greene will come to be remembered as another inflection point in the steady unraveling of institutional norms on Capitol Hill.  That said, we believe that Republicans should have taken matters into their own hands and denied Greene her committee assignments to draw a line against malicious lunacy in their own ranks.  That Democrats had a gun to his head with their threat to have a floor vote on Greene’s committee assignments probably made it more politically difficult for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to act on his own.  He did seek a deal with the Democrats to take her off the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Budget Committee and instead relegate her to the Small Business Committee.  When Democrats didn’t bite, McCarthy again condemned her past comments and wrung an expression of regret from her in an internal GOP meeting earlier in the week that she repeated on the House floor on Thursday.  Her statement didn’t ring with sincerity, but it was better than nothing, even if she was immediately holding a combative press conference where she said, “I’m fine with being kicked off committees because it’d be a waste of my time. ” We have, no doubt, not heard the last of her. #https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-regret-move-against-marjorie-113058115.html#RwBEmsorR

It's not clear if Biden will officially cut off Trump's access, but such a move would be unprecedented — traditionally, former presidents can request and receive briefings.  David Priess, who briefed former President George H. W.  Bush for many years after he left office, told The Washington Post that ex-presidents continue to receive intelligence briefings because even though they're no longer in an official position of power, they are considered representatives of the United States, especially by foreign leaders, for the rest of their lives.  He added that presidents also may turn to their predecessors for advice on international affairs.  That said, Priess agrees with Biden that an exception could be made for Trump since ""there's no chance of Biden reaching out to Trump . . .  So why would Biden run the risk of Trump's disclosure of sensitive information by agreeing to such briefings?"" Journalist Yashar Ali did note that former presidents can also interact with other governments privately, as former President Bill Clinton did when he traveled to North Korea in 2009 to secure the release of two journalists being held there.  Clinton, Ali, notes was briefed even though it wasn't an official U. S.  government trip.  2.  For example, when President Clinton when to North Korea to secure the release of two journalists who were being held by Kim Jong-Il, he was given an intelligence briefing even though the trip was a private one and not an official US government trip.  — Yashar Ali (@yashar) February 6, 2021 Of course, Trump wasn't exactly known for devouring his daily briefings while in office, so it's not clear sending them now would offer the Biden administration much comfort, either way.

ChrisChrisW/iStock via Getty Images PlusThe effect of a drug, or impact of a treatment like chemotherapy, doesn’t just depend on your body.  The success of a particular medicine also depends on the trillions of bacteria in your gut.  The 100 trillion bacteria that live within the human digestive tract – known as the human gut microbiome – help us extract nutrients from food, boost the immune response and modulate the effects of drugs.  Recent research, including my own, has implicated the gut microbiome in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism.  What underlies these apparently discrete observations is the unifying idea that the gut microbiota send signals beyond the gut and that these signals have broad effects on a large swathe of target tissues.  I am a medical oncologist whose research involves developing novel therapies for melanoma.  To evaluate whether altering the microbiome could benefit cancer patients, my colleagues and I evaluated the transfer of fecal matter from melanoma patients who responded well to immunotherapy to those patients for whom immunotherapy failed.  Just published in the journal Science, our results reveal that this treatment helped shrink the tumors of advanced melanoma patients when other therapies hadn’t worked.  What connects cancer and gut bacteria? Gut microbiota have been linked to to the success and failure of multiple cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab.  In the more recent studies, the species and relative populations of gut bacteria determined the probability that a cancer patient would respond to drugs known as “immune checkpoint inhibitors. ” This research showed that differences in the gut microbiome between individual patients were associated with various outcomes to these drugs.  But the precise mechanisms underlying microbiome-immune interactions remain unclear.  Can fecal microbes help drugs reach hard to treat melanoma? Oncologists often treat patients with advanced melanoma using immunotherapies targeting specific proteins on the surface of immune cells known as PD-1 and CTLA-4.  These work in a subset of patients, however – 50%-70% of patients have cancers that get worse despite treatment.  No medical treatments have been approved to treat melanoma patients who have failed PD-1 immunotherapies.  To investigate whether certain types of microbes could boost the efficacy of PD-1 immunotherapies, my colleagues and I developed a study in which we collected fecal microbes from patients who had responded well to this therapy and administered these to cancer patients who didn’t benefit from the checkpoint drugs.  Cancer patients who responded well to immunotherapy donated stool samples.  Their stool was processed to yield material for a fecal microbe transplant.  Diwakar Davar, CC BY-ND We chose stool from patients who responded well to immunotherapy based on the hunch that they would have greater quantities of bacteria implicated in helping shrink the cancer.  As it is difficult to identify one or two species of bacteria that are responsible for the beneficial response to these therapies, we used the entire bacterial community – hence fecal microbe transplant.  Transplant recipients were patients whose melanoma had never responded to immunotherapy.  Both recipients and donors underwent screening for diseases to ensure that no infectious agents would be transmitted during the transplant.  Following a biopsy of their tumor, patients received a fecal microbe transplant from patients who benefited from immunotherapy along with a drug called called pembrolizumab, which was continued every three weeks.  My colleagues and I assessed the fecal microbe transplant 12 weeks after the treatment.  Patients whose cancers had shrunk or remained the same size after the fecal microbe transplant continued to receive pembrolizumab for up to two years.  Results of novel clinical trial Cancer patients who responded poorly to immunotherapy were given a fecal microbe transplant from a cancer patient who did well and a drug called pembrolizumab.  For some of the patients, the microbe transplant made the immunotherapy work.  Diwakar Davar, CC BY-ND Following this fecal microbe transplant treatment, tumors of six out of 15 patients in the study had tumors that shrank or remained the same.  The treatment was well tolerated, though some of the patients experienced minor side effects including fatigue.  When we analyzed the gut microbiota of treated patients, we observed that the six patients whose cancers had stabilized or improved showed increased numbers of bacteria that had previously been associated with responses to immunotherapy.  My colleagues and I also analyzed the blood and tumors from responders.  In doing so, we observed that the responders had lower levels of adverse immune cells termed myeloid cells, and higher levels of memory immune cells.  Additionally, by analyzing proteins in the blood serum of treated patients, we observed reductions in levels of key immune system molecules associated with resistance in responders.  These results suggest that introducing certain intestinal microorganisms into a patient’s colon may help the patient respond to drugs that enhance the immune system’s ability to recognize and kill tumor cells.  Ultimately we hope to move beyond fecal microbe transplants to specific collections of microbes in cancers besides melanoma, paving the way for standardized microbe-based drug therapy to treat immunotherapy-resistant tumors.

Biden will also reportedly appoint experienced diplomat Timothy Lenderking as special envoy to Yemen.  It remains to be seen exactly how this will play out, but as Sen.  Bernie Sanders (I-Vt. ) noted in a statement, it looks like the start of a diplomatic push to get Saudi Arabia to end the brutal war in which it has been bogged down since 2015, obtain a general ceasefire, and coordinate an international aid effort.  The Saudi military basically cannot do anything without U. S.  support, and any strong signals from America that it should knock it off probably will be heeded.  That's especially true now that Trump is gone, and Saudi dictator Mohammad bin Salman thus faces possible recrimination for ordering the cold-blooded murder of a U. S.  resident and Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, back in 2018.  It is worth noting that while Biden is reversing a Trump decision, the Yemen policy actually originated under the Obama administration.  It is a marked difference from the early months of 2009, when Obama kept on George W.  Bush's secretary of defense and planned for a massive troop surge in Afghanistan.  Perhaps two decades of expensive, bloody, and totally unsuccessful wars are enough? More stories from theweek. comGOP Sen.

This week actually brings us two giveaways, one we knew about—For the King, which Epic revealed last week—and another that, as far as I know, is a surprise bonus. For the King is a strategy roguelike about misfit adventurers who strike out to right the wrongs that have befallen their kingdom.  ""It's a goofy dungeon romp personified, with the kind of playful character that has become so popular in Dungeons & Dragons actual play podcasts,"" we said in our 75% review, but also ""often a difficult, ruthless game"" that will not hesitate to kill you.  Your party of three heroes can be controlled by a solo players, but it's really best enjoyed as a co-op experience. The second game going out free this week is Metro: Last Light Redux, the grimy, end-of-the-world FPS set in (and, occasionally, above) the tunnels of the Moscow Metro.  Last Light is more forgiving than its predecessor, Metro 2033, and the Redux release includes a range of new modes and features, gameplay improvements, and all DLC.  And bar none, it's one of the best post-apoc shooters you can get your hands on.  For the King and Metro: Last Light Redux are free until February 11.  After that comes Halcyon 6: Lightspeed Edition, a ""massively enhanced version"" of the 2016 sci-fi base-building strategy RPG.  For even more free games, don't miss our lists of best free PC games, best free games on Steam, best browser games, and all the free games you can grab right now.

At some point in time, a football game became the only annual event that transcends race, religion, gender, or creed in this country, as “Super Bowl Sunday” is the one thing we almost all do.

This, according to a recent genome mapping of primitive fish conducted by the University of Copenhagen, among others.
