E3 2020 was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and while the ESA looked for ways to replace it with an ""online experience"", in the end nothing came of it.  Earlier this year the ESA suggested said that, ""we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021 and will soon share exact details on how we're bringing the global video game community together"" and the above document contains the note, ""Working with production team on broadcast options at LA Live/LACC"".  While it's certainly possible an online version of E3 might come together, even before the pandemic Sony had left E3 to host its own event, and thanks to 2020 the likes of Ubisoft and Bethesda now have experience holding showcase events independently.  The Convention and Tourism Development Board document notes that they are, ""Working on 2022 and 2023 license"", but there's a chance that if things don't come together this year we simply won't see E3 return. Last year we held our regular PC Gaming Show as an online event with more than 50 games on show. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/unsurprisingly-e3-2021s-live-event-seems-to-have-been-cancelled/#7SWLnRRU6

EST in the Gulf of Mexico, Theta, right, and a tropical wave to the south that became Tropical Storm Iota.  An overheating world obliterated weather records in 2020 - an extreme year for hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, droughts and ice melt - the United Nations' weather agency reported Wednesday, Dec.  2, 2020.  (NOAA via AP) A group of scientists from Europe presented new research this week claiming that the Gulf Stream is weaker now than it's been at any point over the last 1,000 years.  The Gulf Stream is an Atlantic Ocean current that plays a largely hidden role in shaping weather patterns in the United States.  Much has been researched and learned about the influential current over the past 500 years, particularly due to the expertise of one of America's Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin.  But in recent decades, a shift in the Gulf Stream's circulation has become weaker than any other time over the last millennium, according to a recently published study by scientists from Ireland, Britain and Germany.  The weakening of the Gulf Stream, formally known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), can be mostly pinned to one catalyst, the researchers said: human-caused climate change.  The Gulf Stream current moves a massive amount of water across the Atlantic Ocean.  According to Stefan Rahmstorf, one of the study's authors, it moves nearly 20 million cubic meters of water per second, acting like a giant conveyor belt.  How strong of a current is that? ""Almost a hundred times the Amazon flow,"" he told the Potsdam Institute.  The Gulf Stream location in the Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System model (RTOFS) from 2016.  (Image via NOAA) The main function of the Gulf Stream is to redistribute heat on Earth by way of the ocean current.  The ocean circulatory system plays a crucial role in many weather patterns around the world, particularly along the U. S.  East Coast.  Rahmstorf said that his team's research was groundbreaking for being able to combine previous bits of research to piece together a 1,600-year-old picture of the AMOC evolution.  ""The study results suggest that it has been relatively stable until the late 19th century,"" he said.  ""With the end of the little ice age in about 1850, the ocean currents began to decline, with a second, more drastic decline following since the mid-20th century. "" An original mapping of the Gulf Stream from Timothy Folger and Benjamin Franklin from 1768.  (Image via Library of Congress) So what are the implications of this decline in the ocean currents? AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Bob Smerbeck said it could plausibly lead to rising sea levels if water levels are warmed this year.  However, Smerbeck added that it is tricky to know just how warm the waters could get.  Previously, studies have shown that rising water temperatures and higher sea levels can lead to more extreme weather events such as stronger tropical storms, a higher likelihood for extreme heat waves or a decrease in summer rainfall.  However, other researchers have also come out with contrasting data, suggesting that the Gulf Stream hasn't actually declined over the past 30 years.  Using a different data modeling system, researchers from the United Kingdom and Ireland pieced together data from climate models that they said in a study published earlier this month showed ""no overall AMOC decline. "" ""Our results reinforce that adequately capturing changes to the deep circulation is key to detecting any anthropogenic climate-change-related AMOC decline,"" the authors write in their study, which was written just days before Rahmstorf's team published its research on the topic.  Smerbeck, who has been a meteorologist at AccuWeather for nearly 25 years, urged caution in how to interpret the new research claims.  ""One possible repercussion discussed in article 1 [the first study mentioned above] about warming waters along the east coast from an AMOC slowdown could lead to rising sea levels due to thermal expansion of the seawater.  This seems plausible,"" Smerbeck said.  But, he added that the amount of seawater rise would depend on how warm that waters could get and he wasn't ready to speculate on that.  This undated engraving shows the scene on July 4, 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was approved by the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, Pa.  The document, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Philip Livingston and Roger Sherman, announces the separation of 13 North American British colonies from Great Britain.  The formal signing by 56 members of Congress began on Aug.  2.  (AP Photo) How was the Gulf Stream as we know it today discovered? Well, the discovery was fueled by a need for increased efficiency with the mail service and was inspired by the empiricism of whalers.  In 1768, Benjamin Franklin was working in London as deputy postmaster, according to The Smithsonian Magazine, responsible for overseeing the arrival of mail to and from the American colonies.  His cousin, Timothy Folger, worked as a captain of a merchant ship at that same time.  One day, Franklin asked Folger why his merchant ships arrived at the colonies much faster than Franklin's mail ships made it back to England.  Folger explained to his cousin that merchant captains followed the advice of whalers, who followed a ""warm, strong current"" to track and kill whales.  While Franklin said mail captains were too prideful to follow the advice of ""simple American fishermen,"" sailing against the current was costing precious time, according to author Laura Bliss.  So Folger sketched out a general location of the current for Franklin, dubbing it the ""Gulph Stream. "" However, Franklin's mail carriers refused to follow the directions.  A chart of the Gulf Stream, published in 1786 in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.  (Image via Library of Congress, Geography and Map Division) But when Franklin switched allegiances to the burgeoning United States during the Revolutionary War, he mapped out a more precise route of the AMOC and gave it to French allies, providing them a key advantage in the battle of European Maritimers, according to The Smithsonian.  The combination of Folger's whaling knowledge and Franklin's mapping would become crucial in later understanding the importance of the current, even if they originally were just trying to figure out how to deliver mail faster.  While knowledge of the AMOC may only go back a few hundred years, Smerbeck said the dating of the currents can be done in a variety of different ways.  Direct measurements with deep-ocean instruments only go back to 2004, he said, but other methods can help piece together the puzzle, such as analysis of coral and historical data from ship logs.  ""Tree rings can tell how wet or dry the nearby land climate was in the past, which can be linked to sea surface temperatures,"" Smerbeck explained.  ""Ice cores can pretty much tell the same thing as well as how warm or cold it was in the past,"" he said.  ""Ocean sediments can show if there were high or low runoff periods from nearby precipitation over land, which could be linked to how warm or cold sea surface temperatures were in the past. "" Researchers have used all of these clues to inform the understanding, which stretches back more than a millennium, they've developed of the Gulf Stream.

S.  housing rally. The company posted adjusted revenue that beat estimates.  And with a ten-fold increase in net income last year to $9. 4 billion, Rocket declared a special dividend of $1. 11 per share, according to a statement on Thursday.  Shares surged as much as 7. 8% to $21. 46 in late trading. “We successfully drove growth in every segment of our business,” Rocket Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner said in the statement. The pandemic real estate boom gave a major boost to the mortgage industry, which posted record loan volume and profits in 2020 as rates dipped to historic lows.  Much of that was thanks to the Federal Reserve, which kept a lid on borrowing costs and bought mortgage bonds as part of its bid to stimulate the economy. But profitability may have peaked.  Rocket reported a 4. 41% profit margin on newly originated loans last quarter, well above the company’s November estimate of 3. 8% to 4. 1%.  It told investors on Thursday to expect margins on new loans this quarter to be around 3. 6% to 3. 9%. Mortgage lenders have been warning investors in recent weeks that profitability won’t expand this year.  UWM Holdings Corp. , the parent company of United Wholesale Mortgage, said profits on new loans this quarter could fall by as much as one-third from last year’s fourth quarter. Mr.  Cooper Group Inc. , meanwhile, said this week that its gains on mortgage sales -- lenders generally sell the loans they originate -- will be roughly flat this quarter. Read more: In a Flash, U. S.  Yields Hit 1. 6%, Wreaking Havoc Across MarketsMortgage rates in the U. S.  rose this week to the highest level in six months, threatening to snuff out the mortgage rally.  And with Treasury yields ticking higher, borrowing costs could continue to climb. That could deter more Americans from seeking to refinance debt, while surging home prices are pushing ownership out of reach for many. Mortgage applications fell to a nine-month low last week, while pending home sales last month dropped to a six-month low.

The Reserve Bank of Australia waded in with more than $2 billion of unscheduled purchases, while Korea announced buying plans for the next few months.  Traders are waiting to see if Japan will act to stop its benchmark yield from breaking out of its target range. The deepening divide between traders and central banks over the pace of the economic recovery looks set to lead to days of showdown, where policymakers seek to retain control over borrowing costs.  The rapid repricing of the reflation trade is rippling through all markets, putting pressure on valuations and hurting government debt auctions. “Reflation now needs a rein, and central banks are fighting the sharp rise in yields,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd.  in Singapore.  “Their credibility is at stake here too -- if they want to maintain accommodative policy they have to act if markets look like they’re running away. ”Read More: In a Flash, U. S.  Yields Hit 1. 6%, Wreaking Havoc Across MarketsThe RBA is taking the lead this time in acting as a breakwater for rising yields, a role typically played by the Bank of Japan in Asia.  Its offer to buy A$3 billion ($2. 4 billion) of debt acted to cap the selloff, with Australia’s three-year bond yield erasing gains.  Treasury yields also came down from the 1. 6% highs reached Thursday night as Asian investors piled in. While the BOJ hasn’t acted yet, Finance Minister Taro Aso fired a warning shot as the benchmark yield surged to within a couple of basis points of the perceived tolerance limit of the central bank.  “It’s important that yields don’t suddenly jump up and down,” said Aso in Tokyo.  “We need to make sure not to lose the market’s trust with fiscal management. ”Read: BOJ’s Tolerance for Rising Yields Tested Before Policy ReviewThe carnage for emerging-markets though continues unabated. Yields on Indonesian bonds -- a bellwether for EM sentiment -- surged to levels last seen in October while Bank Indonesia said it will be in the market to guard against a currency sinking fast.  The Bank of Korea, which has been restrained in debt purchases, said it will spend up to 7 trillion won ($6. 2 billion) to buy bonds in the first half, signaling that it sees a prolonged battle. While markets are increasingly pricing in higher inflation and the potential for rate hikes, every major central bank from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank to the RBA see a prolonged period of easing as economies gradually recover. There are expectations that global central banks will try to contain a further rise in yields, said Kei Yamazaki, a senior fund manager in Tokyo at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.  “Fed officials have been tolerating the recent rise in yields, but the current risk-averse market will also prompt them to calm the market verbally. ”Read: Convexity Hedging Haunts Markets Already Reeling From Bond RoutBond market snapshot:Treasury 10-year yields down six basis points to 1. 46%Australia’s 3-year yield fell one basis point to 0. 12%10-year JGB surged to 0. 175%, a level last seen before the BOJ announced negative interest rates in January 2016Indonesia’s benchmark yields are up 12 basis points to 6. 68%Spreads on high-grade dollar notes from Asian issuers widened about 3 basis points, the most since April last year. Stocks in Asia witnessed a broad selloff.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped as much as 2. 5%, the most since June, with technology shares being the worst performers.  Equity benchmarks in South Korea, China, Taiwan and Japan plunged more than 2% each. The over-riding question for many investors is the extent of the selloff -- many on Wall Street didn’t foresee Treasury yields crossing 1. 5% so quickly -- as each bout triggers stop-losses and lures short-sellers.

S.  seeing record low demand at its Thursday debt auction.  Indonesia has already said it could pare back sales. “At a minimum, this pace of YCC needs to continue next week and I think the market’s looking for even more,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.  “They want to see that the RBA’s prepared to defend its target and to ensure financial conditions don’t tighten. ”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this release for the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures presented and a reconciliation of these measures to their closest comparable GAAP measures.  Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, ""I am proud of our 2020 achievements in light of the significant challenges we faced, primarily in our foodservice channel, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the full year, we grew total net revenues 37%, with sales to retail customers more than doubling versus the prior year. "" Brown added, ""Although weakened foodservice demand resulting from the global pandemic has impacted our near-term profitability, we continue to press forward with strategic investments in service of our future growth, including the build out of our production facilities in China and Europe, bolstering our research and development capabilities, amplifying our marketing voice, upgrading our IT infrastructure, and, importantly, continuing to build out talented teams across the globe to bring our ambitious goals to fruition.  Given our view that we are at a pivotal juncture, where we have an opportunity to transition from niche market to mainstream stature with bold, strategic actions, we will continue to invest aggressively in 2021 to accelerate our path towards this objective.  I truly believe that plant-based meat has reached a tipping point in terms of its cultural relevance and, critically, the fundamentals underpinning Beyond Meat's long-term prospects remain robust, with important brand metrics such as household penetration, buyer rates, purchase frequency and repeat rates all registering another quarter of uninterrupted growth.  My optimism about Beyond Meat's future therefore remains as solid as ever.  As we stay true to our guiding principle of providing consumers with great-tasting plant-based meats, made without the use of GMOs, bioengineered ingredients, hormones, antibiotics or cholesterol, we believe we are on a path to building an enduring global protein company that advances a more sustainable meat supply chain, consumer health and the health of our planet. "" Fourth Quarter 2020 Net revenues increased 3. 5% to $101. 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $98. 5 million in the prior year period.  Growth in net revenues was primarily due to increased retail channel sales, largely offset by a decline in foodservice channel sales due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on foodservice demand levels.  Growth in volume sold during the fourth quarter of 2020 was partially offset by lower net price per pound driven by the Company’s strategic investments in promotional activity, and product mix shifts as larger-pack items carrying a lower net price per unit volume accounted for a greater proportion of the Company's retail net revenues compared to the prior year period.

Adjusted gross profit, which excludes $3. 7 million of expenses attributable to COVID-19, was $29. 1 million, or Adjusted gross margin of 28. 5% of net revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to Adjusted gross profit of $33. 5 million, or Adjusted gross margin of 34. 0% of net revenues, in the prior year period.  The decrease in Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin was primarily due to lower absorption of fixed overhead production costs.  Specifically, recent curtailments of production volumes, mainly in the third quarter of 2020, resulted in the capitalization of higher fixed cost inventory in the third quarter, which was subsequently recognized as higher per unit cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the Company sold off inventory on hand.  In addition, to a lesser extent, Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin also decreased due to lower net price realization resulting from higher trade discounts as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and product mix shifts.  The $3. 7 million in expenses attributable to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of 2020 were driven by incremental inventory write-offs and reserves associated with foodservice products determined to be unsalable.  Loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $24. 5 million compared to loss from operations of $0. 9 million in the prior year period.  The increase in loss from operations was primarily driven by the decline in gross profit, combined with higher operating expenses primarily due to the Company’s increased headcount to support long-term growth, investment in international expansion efforts, specifically in Europe and China, higher production trial costs, investments in IT infrastructure, and continued investments in marketing and research and development.  Net loss was $25. 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net loss of $0. 5 million in the prior year period.  Net loss per common share was $0. 40 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net loss per common share of $0. 01 in the prior year period.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, net loss included $3. 7 million in expenses attributable to COVID-19, specifically related to inventory write-offs and reserves of certain foodservice products.  Excluding these costs, Adjusted net loss was $21. 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, or $0. 34 per common share, compared to Adjusted net loss of $0. 5 million, or $0. 01 per common share, in the prior year period.  Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $9. 5 million, or -9. 3% of net revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $9. 5 million, or 9. 7% of net revenues, in the prior year period.  Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson commented, “We emerged from a challenging year on firm footing and stand ready to capitalize on several opportunities ahead of us.  We believe our resolve to proceed with significant investments in our key strategic initiatives reinforces our long-term position, putting in place the necessary capabilities and infrastructure to support the long-term growth potential underpinned by our strengthening business fundamentals. ” Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $159. 1 million as of December 31, 2020 and total outstanding debt was $25. 0 million.  Net cash used in operating activities was $40. 0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $47. 0 million for the prior year.  Capital expenditures totaled $57. 7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $23. 8 million for the prior year.  The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by the Company’s continued investments in production equipment and facilities related to capacity expansion initiatives.  Separately, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in investing activities also included $15. 5 million of payments for asset acquisitions, specifically related to the Company's purchase of a former co-manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania.  Update on COVID-19 and 2021 Outlook Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to experience significantly reduced demand in its foodservice channel as decreased foot traffic, streamlined menu offerings and restrictions on foodservice locations’ operating capacity have resulted in closures or meaningfully curtailed operations of many of its foodservice customers.  At the same time, the surge in demand from retail customers that characterized the early stages of the pandemic as consumers abruptly shifted towards more at-home consumption has moderated.  Given that the ongoing evolution of consumer demand patterns across retail and foodservice channels has significantly increased the difficulty in forecasting the Company's customer demand levels, management will not be providing 2021 guidance until further notice.  Conference Call and Webcast The Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss these results with additional comments and details today at 5:00 p. m.  Eastern, 2:00 p. m.  Pacific.  Investors interested in participating in the live call can dial 270-215-9602.  The conference call webcast will be available live over the Internet through the “Investors” section of the Company’s website at www. beyondmeat. com and later archived.

In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance and for business planning purposes.  Management also believes these measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of our operational performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.  Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin Adjusted gross profit is defined as net revenues less cost of goods sold adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to COVID-19 which are not considered to be part of the Company’s normal business activities.  Adjusted gross margin is defined as Adjusted gross profit divided by net revenues.  Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin are presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in the Company’s gross profit and gross margin, which we believe is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare the Company’s current business performance from one period to another.  Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share Adjusted net (loss) income is defined as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to COVID-19, as well as other special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company’s ongoing normal business activities.  Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share is defined as Adjusted net (loss) income divided by the number of diluted common shares outstanding.  We consider Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share to be indicators of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations.  Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring expenses, share-based compensation expense, expenses attributable to COVID-19, remeasurement of our warrant liability, and Other, net, including investment income, loss on extinguishment of debt and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.  Limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues rather than their most directly comparable GAAP measures.  Some of these limitations are: Adjusted gross profit and Adjusted gross margin exclude costs associated with activities deemed to be non-recurring or not part of the Company’s normal business activities, which are subjective determinations made by management and may not actualize as expected;Adjusted net (loss) income and Adjusted net (loss) income per diluted common share exclude costs associated with activities deemed to be non-recurring or not part of the Company’s normal business activities, which are subjective determinations made by management and may not actualize as expected;Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future increasing our cash requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring expenses that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect expenses attributable to COVID-19 that reduce cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect share-based compensation expense and therefore does not include all of our compensation costs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect Other, net, including investment income, loss on extinguishment of debt and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, that may increase or decrease cash available to us; andother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Expenses attributable to COVID-19 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include $1. 2 million in product donation costs related to the Company's COVID-19 relief efforts in the first quarter of 2020, which were not previously included in the Company's Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the three months ended March 28, 2020 as these were deemed immaterial to its first quarter 2020 financial results.  Given the significant increase in COVID-19-related expenses in the subsequent quarters of 2020, and to facilitate better comparison from period to period, management determined that it was appropriate to recast its previous first quarter 2020 Adjusted EBITDA calculation to include these costs.
