Senior charge nurse Rosario Walshe leads the team at Ward A31 at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert in the Falkirk Council area and said there has been a “huge spike” in cases recently.  The PA news agency was given access to the 32-bed Covid-19 ward where every bed was taken as hospital referrals have doubled since the first wave.  Ms Walshe believes a combination of family gatherings at Christmas, people ignoring guidelines and the new rapidly-spreading variant is behind the rise.  “I’ve had patients say to me, ‘I wish I had listened, I didn’t listen.  I didn’t really believe it was real,’ so that was quite an eye opener,” she said.  “The last few weeks have been extremely busy and challenging.  It’s definitely different to the first wave.  “We’ve seen a lot more admissions with Covid-related symptoms – we’ve seen lots of groups of family members admitted with Covid, a lot of young people, which you didn’t see so much in the first wave.  “We’ve had some extremely sick people.  Patients discussed with ITU (intensive treatment unit), some transferred to ITU.  It’s definitely been a lot more challenging. ” “The reasons for it getting worse I think I can only assume that people weren’t following the guidelines.  “We’ve seen a huge spike in our cases, so I think we can all assume that family get-togethers at Christmas are one of the reasons our cases have gone up so much.  “It does annoy me slightly, lots of staff members are adhering to the policies and guidelines, trying really hard to socially distance and then you’ve got people who refuse to believe this is real.  We still have the element of people that don’t believe. ”#https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/i-didnt-believe-the-virus-was-real-covid-19-patients-told-nurse/vi-BB1dgGsz#NlcAIQUQy

Why it matters: Zelensky's comments represent a break with U. S.  national security leaders from both major political parties who are trying to rally allies to confront the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. Be smart: sign up FREE for the most influential newsletter in America. Driving the news: Asked about emerging consensus in Washington that China is the No.  1 geopolitical threat, Zelensky said, ""I cannot agree with that because in Ukraine we do not feel this. "" * ""There really is this a sort of cold war between China and the United States,"" he said.  * ""We know United States business is represented in Ukraine, but at the same time, it's true that Chinese business is also represented. "" * ""I believe that regardless of the nation, the nationality, if people, if business, if a certain country, treats you with respect, respecting your people and borders, they can be present in your country. ""Between the lines: There's only so much leverage the U. S.  has to push Zelensky away from China.  Beijing has crushed Washington at vaccine diplomacy — a painful reality that Zelensky discussed in the ""Axios on HBO"" interview.  * Zelensky has tried to obtain for his country the higher-quality American vaccines.  And he’s pushed the Europeans for their help.  But given the difficulty he’s faced to secure doses, he said he is willing to work with Beijing to get large quantities of a safe COVID vaccine for the Ukrainian people.    * Worth noting: The U. S.  did not offer its superior vaccines to Ukraine and in fact took steps to make it harder for Zelensky to obtain them. Behind the scenes: How to handle China is a growing sore point in U. S. -Ukraine relations.  Trump administration officials privately expressed concerns that China — which became Ukraine's top trading partner in 2019 — was flooding Ukraine with easy cash and in return embedding itself in Ukraine's critical sectors including defense and telecom.  * U. S.  officials are worried about China stealing intelligence secrets and wielding nefarious influence over allies who are increasingly beholden to Beijing. Yes, but: Senior U. S.  government officials have been trying for years to persuade Ukraine to stop China from buying Motor Sich, an aero engine manufacturer that is the crown jewel of Ukraine's defense sector.  * In the interview, Zelensky said for the first time definitively that he will not allow China, or any other country, to buy a controlling stake in Motor Sich.  * ""Never,"" he said.  ""Not under me.  I am not here for life. . .  [But] in my time [in office], definitely not. The bottom line: Russia is a far more imminent concern for Ukraine.  But when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, China never condemned Russia's action.  So while Zelensky may not call out China as a threat, he knows that China can't be relied upon in a Russia-Ukraine crisis. Support safe, smart, sane journalism.  Sign up for Axios Newsletters here.

Israel has been praised globally for its speedy vaccination efforts.  And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promoted a quick vaccination of Israel's most vulnerable and the lockdown as dual pathways to a possible reopening of the economy in February. But serious cases have surged among Israelis who have not yet been vaccinated. Officials blame this on foreign virus strains and on lockdown breaches.  Israel's often high-density Ultra-Orthodox communities make up around 15% of the population. But account for some 35% of recent contagions according to the Health Ministry. They are among the conservative Netanyahu's supporters and their violations have been played up by political rivals in questioning the lockdown's efficacy - and building opposition to the Prime Minister ahead of a March 23 election. #https://news.yahoo.com/thousands-ultra-orthodox-jews-defy-174321260.html#3QtVmxiAu

But that's not what's happening, says one expert, and that could mean that if and when the short squeeze does come GameStop's price could soar significantly higher than current levels. What's happening: Short sellers have piled into GameStop as a result of its meteoric stock price rise, not the other way around, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, told Axios. Support safe, smart, sane journalism.  Sign up for Axios Newsletters here.  * Over the past year the amount of shares shorted has increased by 12%, while the total dollars at risk have risen by 1,900%, S3's data show.  * That's a sign that big bets are coming in from hedge funds and institutional investors, meaning that the short squeeze has not even begun. How it works: In a typical short squeeze, short sellers have sold the stock and ""rented"" shares with the intent to buy them after the stock's price falls.  But they are ""squeezed"" out if the price rises too much and they are forced to exit the trade by buying the stock at a higher price.  * That helps the value of the stock rise because the short sellers join the momentum pushing the price higher.  * But with GameStop, every time a short seller exits the market and buys shares, new short sellers are coming in to replace them, keeping the same downward pressure on the price and, in fact, short interest is increasing. What it means: ""That tells me what’s moving the market is the long buyers.  This is not a short covering rally,"" Dusaniwsky said.  * ""If it was I would see shares shorted dropping precipitously.  For this kind of price move, I would have to see short interest being wiped out. "" * ""One way I can see short interest is not being wiped out is because the stock borrow rate is getting higher.  * ""That means shorts are not getting out on a net basis.

During a Jan.  28 interview with MSNBC, chief White House COVID adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, recently name dropped two side effects in particular that he feels should be viewed as a welcome sign that your immune system is responding to your vaccination.  Read on to find out which side effects are good news, and for Fauci's firsthand account of getting the COVID vaccine, check out Dr.  Fauci Says He Had These Side Effects From His Second Vaccine Dose. Fauci explained that the two unpleasant side effects in particular are not cause for worry, but for reassurance.  ""The vaccine, because you're giving it in the arm, it gives a systemic reaction.  You know that because sometimes after the second dose you feel a little achy, a little chilly, which means the immune system is really getting revved up,"" Fauci explained. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that's because the two mRNA COVID vaccines currently approved in the U. S. , from Pfizer and Moderna, do not inject recipients with inactivated virus.  Instead, they teach our own cells to mimic certain features of the COVID virus so that our immune systems can train to fight against it later, if needed. Specifically, the COVID vaccines work by instructing our cells to recreate their own version of the ""spike protein"" found on the outside of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  As more cells create these spike proteins, our immune systems ""recognize that the protein doesn't belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19,"" the CDC says.  So, if you feel those aches and chills that Fauci mentioned, rest assured: that's just your immune system firing up to take down a perceived threat. Wondering what other side effects you might expect after getting your shot? Read on for the most common COVID vaccine side effects that Moderna patients reported, and for more essential vaccine news, check out If You're Over 65, You Shouldn't Get This New Vaccine, Experts Warn.  4 Joint pain Joint pain, known medically as arthralgia, is the fourth most common side effects reported by vaccine recipients: nearly half of those enrolled in the Moderna trials—46 percent, to be exact—experienced this particular side effect in the hours or days after receiving the shot.  And for more on what you shouldn't do before you get your vaccine, check out If You Take These OTC Meds, You Have to Stop Before Getting the Vaccine.  3 Headache Headaches were reported slightly more frequently than joint pain, with 64 percent of patients in Moderna trials experiencing this particular side effect.  According to the CDC, headaches tend to be more common after the second dose. While a study published in the Journal of Virology warned that taking over-the-counter pain medication prior to getting the shot may blunt the efficacy of the vaccines, experts say it's fine to take them afterward to treat vaccine side effects, including a headache.  And for another possible delayed reaction to the shot, check out This COVID Vaccine Side Effect Could Show Up a Week After Your Shot.  2 Fatigue If you experience sudden exhaustion after getting your COVID shot, you're not alone: about 70 percent of Moderna vaccine recipients reported feeling fatigued after their vaccination, making it the second most common side effect. For this reason, you may want to schedule your shot when you know you'll have time to rest afterward, if possible—for example, on a lighter workday, or at the end of your work week.  In fact, after personally experiencing side effects from the COVID shot, infectious disease epidemiologist Saskia Popescu, PhD, recently urged, ""We need to ensure folks have the ability to take time off post-shot. "" And for more regular COVID news delivered right to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.  1 Pain at the injection site The most common side effect reported by Moderna recipients was pain at the injection site: 92 percent of those vaccinated experienced this sensation. ""There are two types of COVID-19 vaccine side effects,"" Teresa Bartlett, MD, senior medical officer at medical claims company Sedgwick, recently told Bustle.  While systemic side effects affect broader body function (fever, chills, and aches are all prime examples), ""local side effects are more common, and involve redness, swelling and perhaps some lymph node swelling in the vaccinated arm. "" And for more on that last side effect she mentioned, check out The Rare COVID Vaccine Side Effect Doctors Want You to Prepare For.

It's also their first third-person horror game, employing a mixture of fixed camera angles reminiscent of 1990s genre classics, first-person bits where you investigate objects for clues, and split-screen sections that simultaneously show what you're up to in the real world as well as a ghostly supernatural otherworld. It's a combat-free experience, focused on using your spirit powers to solve puzzles and a bit of stealth.  Though it's apparently got some performance issues, our reviewer enjoyed The Medium immensely, saying that, ""What it lacks in technical polish it makes up for with chilling set pieces and thoughtful plot developments.

Instead, it ordered tighter border controls, increased police action against curfew breakers, and greater adherence to working from home. Parisians mostly expressed their relief at the move on Saturday (January 30). This woman says the government wants to keep the economy going and save - as much as possible - the national economy.  She adds that if they were to close schools again, it would be a catastrophe. This man says in a personal sense it's pleasant - even mentally - not to have to go through a new lockdown. The French government said the public health crisis remained of great concern as France's death toll jumped above 75,000 - the seventh-highest globally. The Prime Minister Jean Castex said that from Sunday all arrivals into France from outside the European Union would be banned, except for essential travel. All visitors from EU nations would need to show a negative PCR test except cross-border workers and truckers. The country will reduce the number of people allowed into shopping malls and increase police controls against people breaking a night time curfew. While the new curfew measures are stricter than those previously in place, a lockdown would have forced stores to close. #https://news.yahoo.com/parisians-relief-france-avoids-third-160736138.html#E50W1DIFN

However, Mark Zuckerberg failed to persuade lawmakers to change the policy, according to Reuters.  The report also says that Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told Australian Broadcasting Corp, “No, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t convince me to back down if that’s what you’re asking. ” According to the proposed law, news media outlets can negotiate collectively or individually, over content that drives traffic to Facebook and Google’s websites.  If these parties fail to reach an agreement, an arbitrator appointed by the Australian Government will set the fees for both parties.  In view of this proposed law, earlier this month, Facebook had said that it will stop news sharing if the Australian government proceeds while Google threatened to withdraw its search engine from the country.  Companies like Facebook are opposing this law as it would mean an increase in compliance costs and could also put a dent in its advertising revenues as the proposed law also states that companies will have to share their consumer data from such news content.  Advertising is a major source of revenue for Facebook.  (See Facebook stock analysis on TipRanks) In the fourth quarter, Facebook reported advertising revenues of $27. 2 billion, up by 31% year-on-year.  The advertising business made up about 96. 8% of total revenues in 4Q for the company.  Mark Zuckerberg also warned of the timing of “platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape,” during Facebook’s 4Q results.  William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart reiterated a Buy rating on the stock on Jan.  28.  Commenting on the company’s 4Q results, Schackart noted, “In the first half of 2021, Facebook will lap a period of growth that was negatively affected by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic.  Thus, year-over year growth rates in total revenue are expected to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially during the first and second quarters of 2021. ” “In the second half of the year, Facebook will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which is expected to put significant pressure on year-over-year growth rates,” Schackart added.  The rest of the Street is bullish about the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating.  That’s based on 35 analysts recommending a Buy, 3 analysts suggesting a Hold, and one analyst recommending a Sell.  The average analyst price target of $341. 28 implies a 32. 1% upside potential to current levels.

Relaxed restrictions at the Mexican border has lead to an influx of Americans looking to unwind.  While many countries require a negative coronavirus test or a period of quarantine upon arrival, Mexico does not ask for either. In November, the U. S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned the highest travel alert level for Mexico and advised its citizens not to travel to the Latin American country due to an increase in COVID-19 cases. Despite the warnings, thousands flock to the Mexican Caribbean in search of parties and nightlife.

After giving voice to people consumed by “The Shining” (“Room 237”), ventriloquist dummies (“The Wooden Boy”) and sleep paralysis (“The Nightmare”), he’s shifted his attention to simulation theory with “Glitch in the Matrix,” premiering at Sundance just before it goes into wider release.  A subject tailor-made for college, festival and midnight audiences, simulation theory questions human determination by positing that we are merely avatars, and that some greater force — an external gamer, if you will — is our master manipulator.  Much of this concept comes directly from sci-fi writer Philip K.  Dick, who is copiously represented throughout “Glitch. ” Ascher makes much use of a recorded 1977 event in which Dick presents these ideas with utmost sincerity, even while admitting that “I may be talking about something which does not exist.  Therefore, I am free to say everything and nothing. ” Also Read: Rodney Ascher's 'A Glitch in the Matrix' Acquired by Magnolia Ahead of Sundance Premiere Ascher takes a similar approach, wandering through as many musings that’ll elicit a “What?” as much as a “Whoa. ” Speaking of which, it may not surprise anyone to learn that Keanu Reeves is the icon of this ideology, just as “The Matrix” trilogy is its Bible.  He doesn’t, as far as we know, consider these films to be anything beyond fantasy, but there are lots of interviews with adherents like Brother Læo Mystwood, who came to his beliefs after noticing a pattern of synchronicities (some viewers might call them coincidences) in his life.  Ascher transforms many of his subjects into Fortnight-style characters themselves, an approach that feels alternately inspired and unfortunate.  On the one hand, using 3D motion-capture animation to turn people who believe they may be avatars into actual avatars offers a cheeky, if on-the-nose, bit of visual parallelism.  And since we never see their true appearance, they’re afforded privacy while sharing their controversial views.  Also Read: Amazon's 'Electric Dreams' Hints at What Might Have Happened to Real-Life Philip K.  Dick Android That said, neither anonymity nor resemblance to a competitor on “The Masked Singer” does much to boost anyone’s credibility.  In truth, many of them seem to be vulnerable individuals searching for comfort, rather than philosophers or theorists.  But just as we realize this, Ascher shifts into an examination of the reasons simulation and false identity theories have proven popular among adherents.  We’re reminded of the movies that paved the way for cultural infiltration, including Dick adaptations like “Blade Runner,” “Total Recall,” “A Scanner Darkly” and “Minority Report. ” And, of course, there is the franchise that gives this film its name.  In the most troubling, and most memorable, segment, we hear Joshua Cooke describe in detail the events that led to the murder of his parents, while the camera brings us there virtually though animated photogrammetry.  Also Read: Lilly Wachowski Tells Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump 'F-- Both of You' After They Quote 'The Matrix' Cooke connected with Reeves’ character Neo to such a degree that his lawyers prepped a “Matrix Defense,” an insanity plea based on the idea that he deeply believed in a parallel reality.  Ascher leaves us pondering the costs of dissociation, but also its seductive appeal.  Is it really that outlandish to look around occasionally, and wonder at the surreality of it all? “Glitch in the Matrix” opens in select theaters and on-demand Feb.  5.  ﻿ Read original story ‘Glitch in the Matrix’ Film Review: Trippy Documentary Questions the Nature of Reality At TheWrap#https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/glitch-matrix-film-review-trippy-065449379.html#vA5q49xxi

The film is directed by Clint Bentley in his directorial debut and written by Bentley and Greg Kwedar.  It stars Clifton Collins Jr. , Molly Parker, Moises Arias, Logan Cormier and Colleen Hartnett.  Collins stars as an aging jockey who hopes to win one last title for his longtime trainer (Parker), who has acquired what appears to be a championship horse.  But the years — and injuries — have taken a toll on his body, throwing into question his ability to continue his lifelong passion.  The arrival of a young rookie rider (Arias), who claims to be his son and whom he takes under his wing, further complicates the path to fulfilling his dream.  Also Read: 'CODA' Sells to Apple for Record-Breaking $25 Million After Sundance Bidding War The main character in “Jockey” was written specifically for Collins and was based in part on Bentley’s own father, who was also a professional jockey.  The filmmakers spent time on the race track for months before shooting, and the entire supporting cast is made up of real-life jockeys.  “Jockey” is produced by Bentley, Kwedar and Nancy Schafer and executive produced by Larry Kalas, Larry Kelly, Linda and Jon Halbert, Cheryl and Walt Penn, Genevieve and Mark Crozier, Cindy and John Greenwood, Ann Grimes and Jay Old, Benjamin Fuqua, Jordy Wax and Collins Jr.  “Filmmakers Clint Bentley, co-writer Greg Kwedar and producer Nancy Schafer have made such a good movie, that is engaging, satisfying, visual, and precise cinematic storytelling,” Sony Pictures Classics said in a statement.  “Anchored by a truly amazing performance by Clifton Collins Jr. , an actor we have admired in so many roles for over 2 decades, ably supported by Molly Parker and Moses Arias, ‘Jockey’ is about what happens to a professional at the end of a career with the background of horse racing, a subject of interest to audiences worldwide.  We are excited to bring the movie to a wide audience this year. ” Also Read: 'The Sparks Brothers' Film Review: Edgar Wright Makes Playful Documentary About Elusive Band Sparks “We’re overjoyed Sony Pictures Classics will be releasing ‘Jockey. ’ Growing up, watching movies with their logo made us the filmmakers we are today,” said Bentley and Kwedar.  “We were so taken by SPC’s passion and vision and our shared love for Clifton Collins Jr.  It’s surreal for our movie to be in the family of so many incredible films and filmmakers.  This movie was made with so much love, in the vibrant, itinerant world behind the racetrack.  It’s an honor to partner with Michael Barker, Tom Bernard and their team who take such care in how they release films. ” “Through my years of programming film festivals, I would beg Michael and Tom for their latest releases to include in my fests.  They handled the best films from around the world with love and care so it’s a joy to see ‘Jockey’ joining this auspicious line-up,” Schafer said in a statement.  Sony Pictures Classics negotiated the deal with ICM Partners, on behalf of the filmmakers.  International sales were handled by Films Boutique.

The order, which takes effect at 11:59 p. m.  EST on Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), requires face masks to be worn by all travelers on airplanes, ships, trains, subways, buses, taxis, and ride-shares and at transportation hubs like airports, bus or ferry terminals, train and subway stations and seaports.  President Joe Biden on Jan.  21 ordered government agencies to ""immediately take action"" to require masks in airports and on commercial aircraft, trains and public maritime vessels, including ferries, intercity bus services and all public transportation.

2021-01-29 11:30:14#local#Joe Biden’s Abortion Extremism#https://news.yahoo.com/joe-biden-abortion-extremism-113014057.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7vSdskYZ3ns9hZPew6s8cA--~B/aD00NjQ7dz03OTY7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_review_738/fbc55497a544b5262b9e6d3eee12d1df#en#0.0#news.yahoo.com#Joe Biden’s supposed campaign of unity now extends to forcing American taxpayers to subsidize abortion regardless of their moral qualms.  In an executive order on Thursday, Biden rescinded the Mexico City policy, which prohibits U. S.  foreign-aid money from funding groups that provide or promote abortion in other countries.  President Ronald Reagan was the first to enact the policy, which has been in place under every subsequent Republican president and undone by every subsequent Democrat.  Despite his professed personal opposition to abortion, President Biden is no exception.  Announcing the order, the White House affirmed its support for “women’s and girls’ sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally” and dismissed the Mexico City policy with the favored rhetoric of abortion-advocacy groups: the “global gag rule. ” The Trump administration had not only reinstated the Mexico City policy after President Obama’s tenure but also had expanded the rule to cover all foreign-health assistance provided by U. S.  government agencies.  That move increased the amount of aid money covered by the policy from about $600 million to nearly $9 billion.  Following Biden’s executive order, that large pot of federal funding once again will flow indiscriminately to foreign-aid groups such as Planned Parenthood International and other organizations whose chief aim is to profit from an increased number of abortions around the globe — including in countries that reject abortion.  Meanwhile, with the same stroke of the pen, Biden directed his Department of Health and Human Services to consider rescinding a second Trump-administration policy, which prohibits abortion providers from claiming federal funding under the Title X family-planning program.  The current regulation requires abortion groups to financially separate their abortion business from any other services in order to qualify for Title X funding.  Planned Parenthood declined to do so, costing the organization about $60 million a year, a mere pittance of its half a billion in federal funding.  If Biden’s HHS nominee Xavier Becerra is confirmed by the Senate in spite of his lack of qualifications, undoing this policy will almost certainly be one of the first items on his to-do list.  Though pro-abortion activists cheered these moves, the average American appears to have little interest in forcing the taxpayer to fund abortion.  Polling suggests that a majority of the public opposes using U. S.  aid money to fund abortions overseas, as do most Democrats and even most who call themselves pro-choice.  Likewise, a majority opposes federal funding for abortion here in the U. S. , including about a third of Democrats and pro-choice voters.  Despite Biden’s efforts to hide behind his Catholic faith and avoid defending his extremist abortion policy, under his administration, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers need no longer choose between providing abortion and profiting at taxpayer expense. #https://news.yahoo.com/joe-biden-abortion-extremism-113014057.html#tbEA8tHSl

But China says it will no longer recognise the special British passport in question, which has already been in use for years. The British National Overseas passport, or BNO, is purely a travel and identification document, part of a special status created under UK law in 1987 which specifically targets Hong Kong, a former British colony. Britain's new visa scheme will allow BNO holders to live, study and work in the country for five years, and eventually apply for British citizenship. But China hit back at the new program on Friday, saying it would no longer recognize the BNO passport as a valid travel or identification document.  The UK's visa scheme was first announced last year in response to China's new national security law for Hong Kong.  Britain says the law is being used to stifle dissent and breaches the agreement under which the colony was handed back to China in 1997. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday he was ""immensely proud"" of the new scheme, adding that it ""honours our history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong"" and stands up ""for freedom and autonomy. ""And Britain's foreign ministry said Friday it was ""disappointed but not surprised"" by China's swipe at BNO holders. China says the UK's offer of a pathway to citizenship is a violation of international law and interferes with its internal affairs. However, its move to reject BNO passports is largely symbolic. Hong Kong residents normally don't use their BNO passports to travel to mainland China. But it may signal tougher actions from China. The UK's new visa scheme opens the door for an estimated 2. 9 million BNO holders, and a further 2. 3 million eligible dependents, to go to Britain.

Earlier this week, a White House statement said the two leaders agreed to have their teams work urgently to complete the extension of the New START arms control pact between the United States and Russia by Feb.  5, when the current deal expires.  The arms control treaty limits the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each.  The details about the phone call and what was discussed come at a time when Biden is adjusting U. S.  policy in a more robust way toward Russia after predecessor Donald Trump refused to take on Putin directly. "#https://news.yahoo.com/biden-called-navalny-release-putin-191241519.html#aV16SjLea

Eight years later, he has released two duds, withdrew both from stores after a torrent of negative reactions and canceled many more.  For a company that dominates countless areas of retail, consumer electronics and enterprise computing, the multiple failures in gaming show one realm that may be impervious to Amazon. com Inc. ’s distinctive business philosophy.  It tried to make games the Amazon way, instead of simply making games people would want to play. Frazzini is an Amazon lifer who came up in the books section of the website, where he endeared himself to Jeff Bezos as a manager there.  Conventional wisdom inside the company is that if you can run one business, you can run any other.  Amazon’s deep financial resources certainly help.  As head of the games division, Frazzini has acquired established development studios and pushed the company to spend nearly $1 billion for the live video streaming website Twitch.  Frazzini recruited some of the top names in the video game industry, including creators of the critically acclaimed franchises EverQuest and Portal, as well as executives from Electronic Arts Inc.  and other big publishers. Then, according to numerous current and former employees of Frazzini’s game studios, he ignored much of their advice.  He frequently told staff that every Amazon game needed to be a “billion-dollar franchise” and then understaffed the projects, they say.  Instead of using industry-standard development tools, Frazzini insisted Amazon build its own, which might have saved the company money if the software ever worked properly.  Executives under Frazzini initially rejected charges that New World, an Amazon game that would ask players to colonize a mythical land and murder inhabitants who bear a striking resemblance to Native Americans, was racist.  They relented after Amazon hired a tribal consultant who found that the portrayal was indeed offensive, say two people who worked on the project.  The game, previously planned for release last year, is now scheduled for this spring. This story is based on interviews with more than 30 current and former Amazon employees, most of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity citing fears of litigation or career repercussions.  A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment or make Frazzini available for an interview. Amazon is spending nearly $500 million a year operating the video game division, two people familiar with the budget say.  That amount doesn’t include Twitch or a new project under different management, which is building a service to stream games to a computer, phone or Amazon Fire TV. To develop games, Amazon tried to bend a creative and collaborative process to its will, and the results offer lessons to Apple Inc. , Facebook Inc.  and Google, whose efforts so far have been similarly ineffective.  Successful video games are a combination of art, entertainment, technology and very large budgets.  Big tech companies only really figured out the last two. Many of the game developers who joined Amazon found themselves repelled by the corporate culture.  The company is driven by data, and employees are expected to write six-page documents to get major decisions approved.  In game development, on the other hand, a phrase often uttered around the office is “finding the fun. ” It refers to altering and polishing small aspects of a game to figure out what makes the experience enjoyable.  The results are measured only in emotion, which is why many developers say it’s critical for the people in charge to have experience making games. At Amazon’s core is a set of 14 leadership principles.  They include “customer obsession” and “frugality. ” For a company man like Frazzini, they offer a scale by which every member of the team is measured.  “If you don’t come in line with that approach, you’ll struggle at Amazon,” says Jason Child, who spent more than a decade in Amazon’s finance department.  Adapting to the corporate culture counts for much more than expertise, he says.  “If someone is a guru in video games and they go to Amazon, would they be successful? Probably not. ” Jeff Bezos is more of a book guy, but the directive to go into video games came straight from the top.  The Amazon chief executive officer indicated he was willing to spend exorbitant sums of money and offer development teams as long as they needed, say three people who worked directly with Bezos.  All that mattered was that they make the most ambitious games possible, ones that would draw gamers into the Amazon Prime ecosystem and showcase the technical capabilities of its cloud division.  Allowing 10,000 people to play in a single game session was given to the new team as a lofty target.  Two projects under this directive became known around the office as the “Bezos games. ”Bezos views games as yet another way to sell subscriptions to Prime and hook customers on its other offerings, including television shows and movies.  As other e-commerce companies catch up with speedy free shipping, Amazon has sought to add more perks to Prime to justify the price of membership.  Frazzini helped kick off the games initiative in 2012 and soon became boss.  He had risen from the books department to run the section of Amazon’s store that sells video games shipped by mail.  At first, the new group planned to make games for the Amazon Appstore and release them on Android phones, including the ill-fated Amazon Fire Phone, as well as the Fire TV.  By 2014, the company decided to move into games for PCs and eventually consoles.  It was a dramatic change.  Mobile games can be made by small teams in just a few months, whereas bigger ones take hundreds of people toiling away for years. Frazzini set up a new game development operation at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle.  They would later call it Relentless Studios, using one of Bezos’s favorite adjectives for the company.  To help run it, Frazzini tapped Louis Castle, who founded the influential game company behind the Command & Conquer series. Amazon hired celebrated developers like Kim Swift, designer of the puzzle game Portal, and Clint Hocking, director of the shooter Far Cry 2.  It also formed two more studios in California.  The splashy hires kept coming, including Madden guru Richard Hilleman and online gaming pioneer John Smedley.  Today, only Smedley remains.  All declined to comment. At first, new recruits thought they were entering some sort of fantasy land.  Many were paid double the market rate of other game makers in the area, on top of lucrative packages of Amazon stock that just kept rising in value.  Teams had deadlines, but they proved to be flexible, and overtime requests were infrequent, more than a dozen former employees say. One aspect of working at Amazon felt similar to traditional game companies.  The studios cultivated a “bro culture” in which women often weren’t given the same opportunities as men, former employees say.  Four female game developers say their worst experiences of sexism in the industry were at Amazon.  They shared stories of being ignored and undermined by male executives and say they were eventually driven out of the company.  One former employee says male colleagues completely ignored her comments in meetings.  Another says a member of senior leadership impeded her career growth after she disagreed with him and that he created new management positions above her and filled them with men. Other employees registered less consequential complaints about all the company jargon thrown around the office.  Frazzini regularly expounded on the Amazon leadership principles.  One of those was “Hire and develop the best,” which was flattering to employees but didn’t tell the full story.  “The philosophy Amazon takes is: Hiring expertise is secondary to having leaders who follow the Amazon principles,” says Child, the former employee.  “Amazon does hire experts from various industries, but then they expect those folks to adopt the Amazon way. ”The game studios even established their own separate set of principles, although the credos frequently changed and sometimes were in tension with one another, say four people who worked there.  Each game world should accommodate as many players as possible, yet also be fun to play solo at the same time.  They had to be huge financial successes on a Call of Duty scale but also innovative and unlike anything the world had seen before.  To experienced game developers, these rules seemed like a surefire way to not release anything. Amazon didn’t give employees much financial incentive to release anything, either.  Most big game companies pay staff bonuses based in part on the critical and commercial response to their games, but Amazon’s stock plan only rewards employees for time spent at the company.  That led some to prioritize job preservation over anything else, say three former employees.  They say they watched colleagues avoid arguments and only seek to placate bosses like Frazzini, even when they disagreed.  (This was in defiance of the Amazon principle “Have backbone; disagree and commit. ”)Frazzini’s lack of experience in video games showed during project review sessions, a standard industry ritual when the boss plays early prototypes and offers feedback.  His comments were of the focus-group variety, recalls a former Amazon developer: “Why is it this color?” and “Seems fun.  When will it be ready?” On a different occasion, says another developer, the team cringed as Frazzini struggled to differentiate between hyper-polished conceptual footage and live gameplay, a sign he didn’t understand the technology. Some meetings got sidetracked when Frazzini, armed with the latest VentureBeat article about whatever game was making the most money that month, demanded they chase a new trend, four developers say.  The team wound up designing lesser versions of popular games, a desperate strategy laid out in a recent Wired article.  Riot Games Inc. ’s League of Legends inspired an Amazon project called Nova that was canned in 2017.  Epic Games Inc. ’s Fortnite led to another Amazon game, Intensity, canceled in 2019.  Activision Blizzard Inc. ’s Overwatch begot Amazon’s Crucible, which would suffer a similar fate. Amazon’s most successful gaming property isn’t actually a game.  Twitch draws some 26 million people a day to watch live video of other people playing video games.  Frazzini helped secure the acquisition in August 2014 for $970 million, which would later prove to be a bargain.  Various attempts by Facebook, Google and Microsoft Corp.  to build their own live-streaming networks for games have failed. Soon after the Twitch deal, Bezos devised a plan to closely pair Amazon Game Studios with the video site, say two people who met with the CEO.  Twitch would serve as a free marketing vehicle for Amazon games, and the games, in turn, would offer Twitch viewers features they couldn’t get anywhere else. The two teams held daylong brainstorming sessions, but the summits didn’t amount to much, according to people who attended.  One concept they did pursue together was a series of celebrity events to promote their games and sell subscriptions to Amazon Prime.  They held one in New Jersey featuring the Clerks filmmaker Kevin Smith.  Attempts to land other stars, including Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, for a second event in Las Vegas were unsuccessful.  They invited Smith back and then shelved the series. The Twitch chief, Emmett Shear, was reluctant to assign his employees to projects for the game studios, two people who worked with him say.  One proposal, pushed by Frazzini in 2017, asked Twitch to help build a digital game store, the former employees say.  The idea would allow Amazon to avoid paying a 30% sales commission to Steam, the most popular storefront for PC games.  Twitch employees weren’t thrilled because Amazon didn’t have any big games with which to attract shoppers.  Frazzini’s employees assigned to collaborate on the project protested because bypassing Steam would shrink their market, four former employees say.  Withholding a game from Steam, they argued, is the equivalent of refusing to sell a book on Amazon.  When the project was due for more staffing resources, Shear resisted, and it was left to languish inside Amazon Game Studios. Frazzini was more fixated on another project anyway.  Amazon’s designers and programmers needed a game engine, a collection of tools used to build games.  For most studios, there are really only two options.  Epic’s Unreal Engine is Coke, and Unity Software Inc.  is Pepsi.  Amazon, in effect, decided to make an RC Cola.  In 2014, it licensed technology from the German company Crytek for a homemade engine called Lumberyard.  Frazzini then assigned a team of engineers to build the engine and released it to the public in 2016 for free.  The tools are intertwined with Amazon Web Services, setting up Lumberyard as a way to draw a new class of software developers to the business.  Frazzini, who reports to Web Services Chief Andy Jassy, also mandated that all Amazon games be built with Lumberyard, rather than pay for Unreal or Unity. Lumberyard became a bogeyman around the office.  Some features required esoteric commands to function, and the system was painfully slow.  Developers played Halo or watched Amazon Prime Video while waiting for Lumberyard to process art or compile code, several former employees say.  A common refrain around the office, according to a former employee: “Lumberyard is killing this company. ”From the outside, though, Amazon’s game operation was scaring competitors.  It had some of the world’s brightest minds, a deep budget and the most sophisticated internet infrastructure on earth.  It was building a proprietary engine, and at TwitchCon in 2016, Amazon said it was working on three new games: Breakaway, Crucible and New World.  (Nova, the League of Legends copycat, was still under lock and key. ) Over the coming years, all but one would be canceled. In the summer of 2018, Frazzini nabbed his biggest hire yet.  Christoph Hartmann, the new vice president of game studios at Amazon, had spent two decades at Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. , where he published blockbusters such as BioShock and Mafia.  It was a somewhat controversial hire, as Hartmann was also responsible for some high-profile failures, such as The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, which led to the developer’s demise. Still, Frazzini positioned Hartmann as a fixer to staff.  Hartmann loosened the mandate to make everything with Lumberyard, and some teams began prototyping games using Unreal Engine.  Hartmann also pressed Amazon to publish titles made by other companies.  It signed one such deal with the Korean publisher Smilegate to release a game in 2021. Soon after Hartmann’s appointment, Amazon came close to capturing a much brighter star in the media world.  The company informed staff in 2018 that Jason Kilar, a former Amazonian and onetime Hulu CEO, was rejoining to oversee the Amazon games division and presumably become Frazzini’s boss, say two people who were there at the time.  For unexplained reasons, Kilar never arrived.  (The almost-hiring was first reported by technology news site the Information. ) In April 2020, he joined WarnerMedia as CEO. With Frazzini still at the helm, the game studios began aligning themselves with Amazon’s far more successful film and television properties.  The company said in 2019 that it was working with the Chinese developer Leyou Technologies Holdings Ltd.  on an online game based on the Lord of the Rings as a complement to the upcoming Prime Video series.  That same year, Amazon released its first-ever console game, a racing simulation based on the Prime Video show The Grand Tour, a car review series starring the original British stars of Top Gear.  The game bombed.  It drew so few players that Amazon took the unusual step of removing it from storefronts a year later. The embarrassments kept coming.  In May 2020, Amazon released Crucible, the hero shooter inspired by Overwatch.  “One of the things that we hear most often from people who try Crucible is that it feels unique,” Frazzini said in an interview at the time. Gamers weren’t interested.  Reviewers at IGN called it “tedious,” and PC Gamer declared: “Amazon’s long-awaited hero shooter wasn’t worth the wait. ” Twitch didn’t offer much support, either.  A week after release, fewer than 1,000 people were watching Crucible videos on Twitch.  Former employees of the live-streaming unit say Twitch was often reluctant to alter a game’s fate through promotion.  After all, Twitch can’t save a game nobody wants to play.  Amazon pulled Crucible from wide release in June and then killed it in October. Amazon shifted many of the Crucible developers to work on New World.  The project was originally pitched as a survival game in which people would play as colonists in a fictional version of 1600s America, fighting enemies that looked a lot like indigenous people.  The original code name for the game was Roanoke, named after Sir Walter Raleigh’s failed settlements in the 16th century.  When developers at Amazon pointed out to Frazzini’s deputy, Patrick Gilmore, that the setting and villains could be considered racist, he expressed disbelief, according to two people who worked there.  Gilmore didn’t respond to a request for comment.  The disagreement, former employees say, fit a pattern of executives neglecting advice from staff. Developers eventually removed the Native American imagery from New World.  The game was set for release this past August, but after Crucible’s scathing reception, Amazon pushed the debut back to this year.  Still, several Amazon employees are optimistic about the title.  It has received positive buzz from streamers and is the kind of ambitious project Bezos is known to support, employees say. Frazzini is fond of saying anything can be measured, according to two people who worked closely with him.  This philosophy, common in Silicon Valley, is anathema to game industry veterans.  “Nobody who’s successful starts with metrics,” says Seamus Blackley, who helped design the original Xbox.  The Microsoft game console was the last winning incursion into the video game market in the past two decades, despite expensive attempts including Apple Arcade, Facebook Oculus and Google Stadia. Fairly or not, Frazzini gets a lot of the blame for Amazon’s gaming failures at a time when overall spending on video games during the coronavirus pandemic is up significantly.  After the cancellation of Crucible, an outgoing employee entered the Seattle office to collect personal belongings and found a crass message in big blue letters scrawled on a whiteboard: “Fraz is cancer. ” Orbiting the note was a handful of “+1”s written in assorted colors. The biggest new game product from Amazon has nothing to do with Frazzini.  Amazon Luna lets subscribers instantly play console-grade games without the need to buy pricey hardware or wait hours to download a large file.  The team released a version for Android devices in December, and the service remains in early access limited to customers who request an invitation. The Luna project is overseen by David Limp, who runs the devices division that produces the Echo and Kindle.  In its current iteration, Luna offers more than two-dozen games, none of which are made by Amazon Game Studios.  “I hope that they have a hit,” Limp said in an interview in September.  “But in addition, I think it’s equally important for us to build a system, and I think Luna has the starting points for that. ”In many ways, the approach to games mirrors the one that eventually led Amazon to some success in Hollywood.  It tried a bunch of different things—develop a streaming service, set up a studio, produce TVs and films, build a set-top box—and selected an Amazon insider, Roy Price, to run it.  Price produced a handful of bad shows before Transparent won Amazon its first Golden Globe in 2015.  Then came Oscars for Manchester by the Sea and more Golden Globes for The Marvelous Mrs.  Maisel.  Price was ousted in 2017 over sexual harassment allegations, and Bezos took the unlikely step of looking outside of the company, to Hollywood, for his replacement, Jennifer Salke.  She cemented Amazon Prime Video as an important part of the company’s business strategy.  People sign up for Prime to watch The Boys, and they buy more stuff on Amazon. Amazon could still do the same in gaming.  Luna demonstrates a continued commitment, as do the investments in New World and as-yet-unannounced projects including a secretive new game from Smedley, who laid the foundation for massively multiplayer online games in the late 1990s with EverQuest.  After Amazon’s misadventures in gaming, there’s at least one passage from the leadership principles the company will still hope to prove: “Leaders are right a lot. ” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

What Happened: ""Those who have built the Bitcoin and supported the dream of making this new kind of money a reality have done a fabulous job of sustaining that dream and moving Bitcoin into being an alternative gold-like asset,"" Dalio said in a note to the hedge fund clients on Thursday.  The hedge fund manager made the clarification of his stance on the cryptocurrency to clear the air on the different interpretations in the media.  ""I believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention,"" Dalio wrote.  The hedge fund manager clarified that by ""Bitcoin,"" he means the leading cryptocurrency and ""its analogous competitors. "" The fact that a new of money was invented through a system that is programmed into a computer and is rapidly gaining popularity both as a type of money as well as a ""storehold of wealth"" is an ""amazing accomplishment,"" he added.  Dalio sees it as a gold-like safe-haven investment, satiating the growing need for money or ""storehold of wealth assets"" that are limited in supply and can be privately held.  Why It's Important: Bitcoin, which was trading around the $11,000 level in October, has been going higher ever since and ended 2020 with a 300% gain.  The leading cryptocurrency traded at $34,121. 46 at press time.

The California oil titan lost a penny per share during the fourth quarter, compared with the Bloomberg Consensus for a 7-cent profit due to a weak performance from its refineries, where runs were reduced substantially in response to lower demand for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline.  Analysts expressed disappointment that the company failed to raise its first-quarter dividend despite having lower debt than peers. “The absolute metrics do not make for great reading,” Alastair Syme, a London-based analyst at Citigroup Inc. , wrote in a note.  “The simple message is that Chevron (and integrated oil company peers) is not well suited to a sub-$50 oil price world. ”A substantial rally in oil and gas prices since Covid-19 vaccines were first approved in early November isn’t enough to lift the doom and gloom surrounding Big Oil stocks.  While executives will use the extra cash to pay down debt and begin to rebuild their reputations with investors, steep hurdles remain.  Chevron won’t resume its production growth plan for the Permian before the pandemic is in the rearview mirror, sees continued pressure in its refining division and is taking a cautious approach to shareholder payouts, executives said. READ: Chevron Says Permian Growth Restart Depends on Pandemic, OPEC+The stock dropped as much as 4. 6% Friday, underperforming the S&P 500 Energy Index which traded 3. 2% lower at 2:05 p. m.  in New York. While Brent crude traded up 0. 7% to $55. 92 a barrel, near the highest since February, there’s “downside risk” to prices, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on a conference call with analysts. “We are still in the middle of a pandemic, demand is still off and in total the global economy is functioning below its capacity,” he said.  “Oil prices today are supported in part by a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take a million barrels a day off the market. ”Chevron maintained its dividend at $1. 29 a share this week, in contrast to a hike in the first quarter of last year.  “Some people were maybe a little surprised you didn’t increase your dividend the other day,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.  analyst Phil Gresh said on the call. Wirth said cuts to capital spending and costs last year means that Chevron now generates free cash flow in excess of its dividend at oil prices below $50 a barrel and that growing the payout in the future is the company’s top priority. Evidence of why a cautious approach is needed came in Chevron’s fourth-quarter results.  Even after aggressively cutting capital spending by a third, it was still almost $3 billion more than incoming cash flow.  That meant borrowing more to protect dividends, contributing to a 64% increase in debt to $44. 3 billion in 2020.  To be sure, half of the rise in borrowing came from the recent acquisition of Noble Energy. Low crude prices and $338 million in losses from Chevron’s global network of refineries wiped out most of the gains from harvesting oil and gas during the quarter.  Crude input at its U. S.  refineries dropped by 17% in response to fewer orders for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline. “We’ll see a recovery in the upstream that’s going to happen a little bit before the downstream,” Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said during a Bloomberg TV interview.  Though uncertainty remains, the second half of this year “looks more like normal. ”Added costs amounted to the recent acquisition of Noble Energy totaling $120 million, higher pension charges and downtime at Australian liquefied natural gas operations also weighed on earnings. When asked about Chevron’s approach to the energy transition, Wirth stuck to the script, insisting that the company would not invest heavily in anything where it doesn’t hold a competitive advantage, like wind and solar, drawing a contrast with European rivals.  Chevron’s strategy is to lower emissions from its own operations including power sources and invest in carbon capture and small-scale technology ventures that have a competitive edge.  He sounded caution on soaring valuations of clean-energy start-ups. “Things that are supported by low interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term,” Wirth said.  “When the day comes that interest rates are up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we invested in things that can sustain in that environment?”(Updates with CEO comment in sixth paragraph. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

S. , and the company will ask federal regulators for approval in February.  Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna candidates, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is administered in one shot.  The vaccine uses a relatively new technology to deliver a coronavirus gene into the body by using a modified form of the common cold.  The gene instructs bodily cells to make a protein similar to coronavirus, which wards off infection.  While the vaccine is not as effective as those of Pfizer and Moderna, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is still strong enough to give widespread protection from coronavirus.  The company has the ability to ship millions of doses, and a February approval would add the vaccine to the tools currently being used to fight the pandemic.  While the vaccine’s efficacy rate was 72 percent in the U. S. , that rate dropped to 57 percent in trials in South Africa, where a new variant of coronavirus is spreading.  The variant, labeled B. 1. 351, has also been found to slightly reduce the efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.  Concern over the variant prompted the Biden administration to impose a travel ban from South Africa earlier this week. #https://news.yahoo.com/johnson-johnson-releases-single-dose-135027318.html#N9rN6mT3e

What Happened: Dogecoin, a digital currency that was launched as a joke, has surpassed all-time high today, growing by 420. 29% in a matter of one day, according to a data analytics platform CoinMarketCap.  The cryptocurrency is currently traded at $0. 03831 at the time of publishing.  pic. twitter. com/a6kmk0PEgM — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 28, 2021 Musk’s followers recognized the tweet as an endorsement to the current Dogecoin rally, expressing overwhelming support in the Dogecoin future.  Why It Matters: This is not the first time Elon Musk has expressed his interest in the digital currency.  See also: Today’s Dogecoin Price In December, Tesla CEO tweeted “One word: Doge” sending the cryptocurrency to a 20% surge.  Before that, his July tweet caused a 14% spike in Dogecoin price.  CoinMarketCap Head of Listings, however, in a conversation with Benzinga has warned traders about possible ramifications following a call to buy Dogecoin in a Reddit group that caused the recent price spike.  ""It bears mentioning that all of this [the spike and the Reddit thread]takes place against a discernible shift in the cultural milieu, one where WSB has become emblematic of a grassroots Reddit movement that seeks to repudiate the entrenched interests and ossified power structures of WallStreet.

The company, based in the Hainan provincial capital of Haikou, was served with a petition on January 29 in the provincial High Court seeking its bankruptcy and for it to undergo restructuring, HNA Group said in a statement on its WeChat account.  The company will cooperate with the court's review, push forward with the debt restructuring work and support the court to protect the legitimate rights and interests of creditors, HNA Group said.  Company executives could not be reached to elaborate.  Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.  HNA Group was established on the foundations of Hainan Airlines in 1993 by Chen Feng, who worked for the civil aviation authority before going into business.  With a handful of aircraft, Hainan Airlines quickly built a business flying holiday makers and Russian tourists from China's frigid north to the country's sole tropical island, long regarded as ""China's Hawaii"" for its tropical beaches, azure waters and holiday resorts.  HNA Group's statement on WeChat alt=HNA Group's statement on WeChat The airline, which stood out from its peers for its punctuality, in-flight service and new fleet, quickly expanded.  It counted financier George Soros as its largest foreign shareholder, and ventured into logistics, tourism and real estate.  By 2017, the group had ballooned into a global conglomerate with 290,000 employees.  Fuelled by bank loans and armed with money earned from its aviation business, HNA Group went shopping, raking up stakes in Hilton Hotels and Resorts, Deutsche Bank and Ingram Micro, among dozens of other brand name assets.  The acquisition spree came to an end in 2017 when China's financial regulators, fearful of risks to the banking industry, cracked down on the debt-fed binge, putting HNA Group, Anbang Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun Group under scrutiny.  Anbang, an insurer turned asset buyer - it made a failed US$13 billion bid to take over Starwood Hotels - has since been put under state ward and its former chairman thrown into jail on fraud and embezzlement charges.  Source: Various public records, SCMP alt=Source: Various public records, SCMP In February 2020, a working group comprising government officials representing the aviation regulator and Hainan provincial authorities was formed to restructure HNA Group's finances.  HNA Group had at least 1 trillion yuan (US$154. 8 billion) of assets as recently as 2017, driven by Chen's ambition for his conglomerate to make it among the Fortune 100 list of the world's largest companies by assets.  Chen has been barred from luxury spending since September last year under a court order, after a subsidiary of HNA Group failed to pay an investor in a lawsuit.  Chen was left out from a Communist Party committee that runs HNA Group this week, in a sign that he had lost control of his conglomerate after three decades at the top.

Photo: Xiaomei Chen HNA Group made headlines in Hong Kong in 2016 when it snapped up four plots of oceanfront commercial and residential land at the former Kai Tak airport for HK$27. 22 billion (US$3. 5 billion), all at a substantial premium to market valuations, outbidding the city's largest developers.  It was HNA Group's shopping in Hong Kong that began its undoing.  Hong Kong's developers, some of whom had been represented in China's top political advisory body going back decades, complained to Chinese authorities about the ""market disruptions,"" sources familiar said.  Less than two years after buying them, HNA Group had resold the last of its Kai Tak plots to Hong Kong developers.  After the government's crackdown, HNA Group reversed course and disposed of all its land in Hong Kong.  The last of the four plots was sold in 2019 for a HK$550 million loss to Wheelock and Co.  in 2019.  Besides land, HNA Group also owns Hong Kong Airlines, one of four carriers that used to be based in the city.  HNA Group's stake in Hong Kong Airlines is up for grabs, as Air China and other parties are in talks to seize control of the carrier, people familiar with the matter said last year.  Shares of Hong Kong jewellery maker Hifood, 75 per cent owned by HNA Group, are up for sale.

2021-01-28 20:07:35#health#Weed withdrawal: More than half of people using medical cannabis for pain experience withdrawal symptoms#https://news.yahoo.com/weed-withdrawal-more-half-people-200735378.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IA3vX434xlTY.P5MHL14_g--~B/aD04Njg7dz0xNDQwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_us_articles_815/cb306b4f3789bfc2d80e8a4e3dfde3b6#en#-0.4767#news.yahoo.com#The use of cannabis, though safer than many other drugs, is not entirely without risk.  AP Photo/David Zalubowski, file CC BY-ND In stark contrast to the overblown fears portrayed during decades past, these days, most people think cannabis is relatively harmless.  While weed is indeed less dangerous than some other drugs, it is not without risks.  In a study published Jan.  5, my colleagues and I found that 59% percent of people using medical cannabis for chronic pain experienced moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms if they stopped ingesting weed for hours or days.  Most states in the U. S.  have legalized cannabis for medical purposes and 15 have legalized it for recreational use.  More people are using cannabis, especially older adults, and the perceived harms from weed use are steadily decreasing.  While many people report therapeutic benefits or enjoy recreational use of cannabis, it is important people understand the potential risks of cannabis use too.  What cannabis withdrawal looks like Cannabis withdrawal symptoms can include both physical and psychological experiences that emerge when someone comes down from being high or goes for a period of time without use.  When people use cannabis regularly – such as daily or nearly daily – parts of the brain become reliant on cannabinoids, the psychoactive chemicals in cannabis.  Cannabinoids are naturally produced in the body, but at a much lower level than is available in most cannabis products.  Among those who don’t use weed for a period of several hours or days, cannabinoid levels drop and they experience withdrawal symptoms.  These can including irritability, depressed mood, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, a desire or craving to use cannabis, restlessness, anxiety, increased aggression, headaches, shakiness, nausea, increased anger, strange dreams, stomach pain and sweating.  Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually go away within one to two weeks after use is stopped as the body adjusts back to its own natural production of cannabinoids.  Unlike withdrawal from some psychoactive substances – such as alcohol – cannabis withdrawal is not life threatening or medically dangerous.  But it does exist.  Cannabis withdrawal can also be quite unpleasant and people can end up continuing their cannabis use – even when they want to cut back – just to avoid experiencing withdrawal.  Regular use of cannabis can result in dependency and withdrawal when a person stops using cannabis.  AP Photo/Ted S.  Warren How common are withdrawal symptoms? To figure out how common withdrawal symptoms are, over two years, my colleagues and I repeatedly surveyed 527 people who were using medical weed for chronic pain.  We found that 59% of people who use medical cannabis for chronic pain had moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms.  The most common symptoms were sleep difficulties, irritability and anxiety.  We also found that cannabis withdrawal symptoms were more severe in younger people, people with mental health problems, people who had a longer history of cannabis use and people who used more frequently or in larger amounts.  Additionally, we found that smoking cannabis – rather than eating or topically applying it – was correlated with worse withdrawal symptoms.  Our team also looked at how people’s withdrawal symptoms changed over time.  Most continued to experience the same severity of withdrawal symptoms any time they stopped ingesting cannabis over the two years of the study, but about 10% – particularly younger people – got worse over time.  As with most dependency-forming substances, reducing the frequency or amount of cannabis use may help to alleviate these symptoms.  Our study looked at people who use medical cannabis only for pain.  But in another recent meta-analysis that included both recreational and medical use, researchers found that 47% of frequent cannabis users experience withdrawals.  Cannabis may not be the demon drug from “Reefer Madness,” but neither is it a wonder–plant with limitless upsides and no downsides.  As cannabis use increases across the U. S. , it’s important for people to understand that regular use can lead to withdrawals, and to know what those symptoms are.

2021-01-28 21:30:31#business#Silver Is the Latest Market Hit by Reddit Day-Trader Frenzy#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-latest-market-hit-reddit-151147282.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JDQZguWhnH9ymsYDPa7bdw--~B/aD0xODE5O3c9MTEyNTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/6b1f5367d9cc5058bbd2752da7f5c323#en#-0.3182#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- The first signs that the silver market was about to get hit came Wednesday. Comments began appearing on the Reddit chatroom r/wallstreetbets -- the investor board now famous for fueling an astonishing short squeeze in Gamestop Corp.  that sent its market value soaring by 788% in a week.  Posters started egging each other on to pile into IShares Silver Trust, the largest silver exchange-traded fund around, saying banks have been manipulating silver prices, keeping them artificially low and masking a shortfall in physical supplies.  One post described it as “THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD. ”If this sounds all too familiar, it’s because it has been the rallying cry of conspiracy theorists in precious metals circles for decades, if not centuries.  With their constant railing against banks and big government colluding to mask inflation, it was only a matter of time before they and retail investors raging against the financial machine joined forces. To say there was a strategy may be overstating things, but the impact was felt across the markets. Small silver miners began surging first thing in the New York morning Thursday with First Majestic Silver Corp. , cited on Reddit as a short-squeeze target, soaring as much as 39%.  Then retail investors started flooding into IShares Silver Trust, driving it up by as much as 7. 2%.  Spot silver gained 6. 8% at one point, the biggest jump since August. “There’s a short squeeze going on in silver.  The ‘hoodies are all rolling into silver and the party is on,” Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures LLC in Chicago, said in a phone call.  “All those other stocks like GameStop and AMC, they’re dumping because they’ve been restricted, and they gotta go into other short opportunities and silver is an easy identifiable target. ”The economic data that came out Thursday morning, which included a larger-than-expected drop in jobless claims, have become “a moot point” for traders, Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures said by phone.  “This isn’t predicated on any global events, it’s just people on a message board putting all their guns towards the precious metals markets. ”Options markets were bid up in the frenzy, with traders and brokers seeing wide bid/ask spreads on the IShares and Comex contracts.  A record 3. 1 million IShares Silver Trust options contracts traded. “The implied volatility being quoted in the options market at this moment is wider than I’ve ever witnessed. ” James Gavilan, principal and adviser at Gavilan Commodities LLC, said in a phone interview.  “The market is factoring in large swings in the silver price, and an already illiquid market is showing extremely wide quotes for options, which means that traders are concerned about the difficulty of hedging their positions. ”To see such wide volatility spreads is “mind boggling, breath taking, it’s shocking really,” said Gavilan. The buying in silver and gold spilled over to the base metals complex on the London Metal Exchange, with copper erasing early losses, while “Chinese night desks buying” also helped the metal, according to Tai Wong, head of metals derivatives trading at BMO Capital Markets.  Copper for three-month delivery rose 0. 6% to $7,873 a ton in London.

ANU Cosmologist Dr Brad Tucker told Sky News the company was founded by a previous NASA astronaut and now “has the contracts to actually go and stay in the international space station”. A private citizen will be charged $71 million to travel to the space station for an eight-night stay. “Some of the money goes to the private company to support the endeavours and other goes to NASA to actually keep the space station ticking over,” Mr Tucker said. “What NASA is also offered this private company is they can, by 2024, build their own part of the space station and then manage it themselves. ”He said passengers would have to undergo a health screening and a 15-week training program before NASA will allow them to launch. #https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6227203473001#hVUpzK6jl

South Korea’s biggest company reported net income in the three months ended December of 6. 45 trillion won ($5. 84 billion), missing the 7. 3 trillion won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares fell 2. 2% in Seoul on Thursday. Samsung, the world’s largest maker of memory chips and displays, struck a cautious tone that stood in contrast to that of many technology companies benefiting during the coronavirus lockdowns.  Just hours earlier, Apple Inc.  and Facebook Inc.  reported financial results that handily exceed estimates. “In the first quarter, we expect overall profitability to decline due to relative weakness in the memory and display businesses,” said Ben Suh, executive vice president of investor relations, during a call with investors.  In the memory business, Samsung’s most important profit engine, “results are likely to weaken due to currency effects and continued costs associated with new fab ramp up. ”Operating profit for the semiconductor unit was 3. 85 trillion won in the fourth quarter, short of the 4. 62 trillion estimate from analysts.  The company said it expects a recovery in the business in the first half. Samsung said it’s tracking whether chip shortages that have hit the global auto industry could spill over to other sectors, including tech products. “This is a global issue,” said Han Jinman, executive vice president of the memory business.  “There is a possibility that the shortage of other semiconductor parts may impact mobile demand and so, we are carefully watching how that plays out. ”In the smartphone business, Samsung struggled in the holiday period as Apple introduced its first 5G-capable iPhones and Chinese rivals put up fierce competition.  The Cupertino, Calif. -based company took over the No.  1 position in the fourth quarter, ahead of Samsung and China’s Xiaomi Corp. , market research firms said on Thursday. With a lot of good devices on the market, “there is only so much that Samsung can grab out of it,” said Kiranjeet Kaur, research manager at IDC. Investors had anticipated Samsung could increase its dividend payout substantially, in part because the founding Lee family faces an enormous inheritance tax bill.  Instead, the company said it would continue to return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders between 2021 and 2023, although its annual dividend payout will increase slightly to 9. 8 trillion won. The results come just days after Samsung’s de-facto leader, billionaire heir Jay Y.  Lee, was sent back to prison on bribery charges.  Although professional managers lead the company’s operating units, Lee has played a central role in major strategic decisions. The company signaled it will continue to press ahead with critical deals and investments.  Samsung will use its capital to expand the capacity of its foundry business, which fabricates chips for clients like Nvidia Corp. , to meet demand and overcome current supply shortages.  It will also invest in facility expansions and “meaningful” acquisitions, the company said. “For the last few years, we have been evaluating possible M&A opportunities very carefully and have made significant progress in terms of preparation,” Choi Yoon-ho, chief financial officer of Samsung, said during the earnings call.  “Although it is difficult to pinpoint a specific timing due to uncertainties in the internal and external business environment . . .  we are optimistic of carrying out meaningful M&A activities during this term. ”Read more: Samsung Surges to New High on Strong Memory Market OutlookAnalysts including Yungsan Choi of Ebest Investment & Securities have been anticipating a long-awaited rebound in memory chip prices due to demand for servers and more powerful 5G smartphones.  Component supplier Murata Manufacturing Co.  and chipmaker MediaTek Inc.  both anticipate more than half a billion 5G handsets to be shipped this year. Chipmakers Intel Corp.  and Micron Technology Inc.  gave a bullish forecast for the first quarter of this year on continued demand for computers and phones that enable working and studying from home.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  is planning another record-breaking year of investment with as much as $28 billion set aside to expand and improve its production capacity at a time of silicon supply shortages affecting everyone from global automakers to mobile tech giants like Apple and Qualcomm Inc. Samsung’s contract chip manufacturing is expected to expand with the addition of Intel as a customer.  The two companies have discussed development and production of Intel’s mainboard chipsets over the last two years and Samsung will produce the chipset at its Austin, Texas plant starting from this quarter, Meritz Securities said in a note. Samsung Is Said to Mull $10 Billion Texas Chipmaking PlantThe existing Austin fab is capable of operating on a 14-nanometer process.  With rising expectations of growth in the foundry market, Samsung is considering building a cutting-edge logic chipmaking plant in the region that would be capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3nm in the future, Bloomberg News reported earlier. “Regarding investments including building a fab in the U. S. , we haven’t made a decision yet,” said Shawn Han, senior vice president.  “Due to the nature of foundry business that requires timely and efficient responses to customers’ demand, we routinely review capacity expansions.  We continue to study ways to optimize operations at fabs in all regions from Giheung, Hwaseong to Austin. ”(Updates with executive comment on shortages in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

And take careful note of detailed specifications including clock speeds and TDP ratings.  That’s the take away from a list of mobile RTX 30 Series GPUs acquired by ComputerBase. All told there are 28 variants representing dramatic differences in specs including TDP and clock speed across the three tiers of GPU and various vanilla and Max-Q branded models.  The overall upshot? The fastest variant of the entry-level RTX 3060 mobile GPU is comparable with the bottom end of the RTX 3080 Max-Q tier for raw graphics processing. By way of example, do the maths and the highest clocked RTX 3060 is good for 9. 3TFLOPS while the slowest 3080 cranks out 9. 6TFLOPS.  The gap is a little bigger if you compare throughput at boost clocks.  Factors like Dynamic Boost, which can add additional performance headroom, complicate matters further. But get this.  If you then compare the fastest RTX 3080 with the slowest RTX 3060, the figures are 16. 6TFLOPS and 6. 3TFLOPS.  In other words, depending on which RTX 3060 and 3080 variants you pick, the gap might be very narrow.  Or it might be 2. 5 times the raw performance. #https://www.pcgamer.com/with-28-flavours-graphics-card-names-mean-almost-nothing-for-next-gen-nvidia-gaming-laptops/#PgtrLmFHE

It truly is the ultimate smartphone, especially for photographers who want the best hardware the money can buy.  Like last year's S20 Ultra, this year's model sports a 108MP main camera sensor that promises to deliver incredibly sharp photos in daylight and low light situations thanks to its unique nona-binning technology that allows for 9 to 1 pixel binning.  The other three cameras on the back of the phone include a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, a 10x periscope telephoto camera and a final 12MP sensor paired with a 120-degree ultrawide lens that also doubles as a macro camera.  Up front, the Galaxy S21 Ultra features a 40MP selfie camera.  For video capture, Samsung has bumped up the resolution and frame rate for all five cameras to 4K/60, a first for a smartphone since most devices that feature a 4K selfie camera are limited to 30fps.  The only downside is that the phone isn't able to switch between the four different lenses on the back of the phone while recording at 4K/60, so you'll need to bump things down to 4k/30 if that's a feature that's important to you.  https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=21qJ-xYwoKA To give you an idea of what the cameras on the Galaxy S21 Ultra are capable of, we took the phone out and captured more than 100 photos and videos.  There's really a lot to like with the camera setup on the S21 Ultra since the four cameras on the back give you a lot of different options when it comes to framing your shot.  It's almost like having a DSLR with a good zoom lens with you at all times.  So far, I'm pretty impressed with the results and have not noticed any glaring issues with the images or videos that the cameras on the S21 Ultra produce.  We'll be putting together a detailed camera comparison with the Galaxy S21 Ultra and other devices like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12, and a handful of other flagship devices from 2020 to give you an idea of how Samsung's new 2021 flagship device stacks up against the competition.  Take a look at the video and photo gallery and let us know what you think of the Samsung Galaxy S21's cameras.

Remember when the mom of seven got a non-surgical facelift in January 2020? After the treatment, Braunwyn took to Instagram to share all the details on it (while still bandaged up).  In January 2021, Braunwyn let us in on more of her beauty secrets.  On January 2, Braunwyn dished on the cosmetic reason why her breasts look so good after breastfeeding seven babies.  (Spoiler alert: They're fake. ) And even more recently, Braunwyn took to social media to unveil the results from her latest treatment, which focused on her stomach.  In early January, The Real Housewives of Orange County stunner got a microneedling procedure on her stomach by Dr.  Jennifer Armstrong MD.  For those who aren't familiar with microneedling, the technique uses tiny needles to puncture the skin in order to promote collagen production.  The method tightens loose skin and improves the appearance of scars and wrinkles.  On January 18, Braunwyn shared a peek at her results with a steamy swimsuit snap.  ""5 days post [microneedling] on my tummy!!"" Braunwyn captioned the photo.  The mom of seven flaunted her fab figure in an itty bitty bikini.  The chic two-piece featured a plunging, black bandeau top and matching bottoms, which Braunwyn accessorized with gradient, oversized shades.  Photo: Braunwyn Windham-Burke/Instagram This isn't the only cosmetic treatment Braunwyn recently received.  In a video posted by Dr.  Armstrong, we got a glimpse at Braunwyn's latest clinic visit in which she got a Cynosure laser treatment and Potenza RF Microneedling.  ""I never come in here knowing what I’m going to do because I trust [Dr.  Armstrong] so much!"" Braunwyn said in the clip.

The shocking allegation was reported by Andrew MacGregor Marshall, the former Reuters bureau chief in Bangkok, in his subscription-only newsletter, Secret Siam. Marshall, who is free to quote his Thai sources without fear of the country’s vicious censorship laws since he left Asia, reports that the king is alleged to have attacked his sister after she was knocked over by his dogs.  Insiders claimed that he either jumped on her legs or beat her with a cane.  The assault was allegedly prompted after she confronted him over his plans to make his official consort a second queen, alongside his present wife, Queen Suthida. King of Thailand Allegedly Ruling His Nation From German Ski Resort With a Retinue of ConcubinesThe Thai nobility has recently been alive with rumors that King Maha X is set to elevate his official consort, Sineenat “Koi” Wongvajirapakdi, to the status of full queen.  The proposed scheme apparently went down badly with his sister, Princess Sirindhorn, who went to see her brother to try to change his mind about two weeks ago. This appears to have been a bad idea; the palace recently announced that Sirindhorn had injured both of her ankles in a fall, and had been taken to the hospital, but, MacGregor Marshall says, citing “well-placed sources” in “informed palace networks,” that this is less than half the story. In fact, he alleges, “a furious row erupted” during the meeting and “she was knocked over by one of Vajiralongkorn’s dogs, and while she was lying on the ground he either stamped on her ankles or struck them with a cane, shattering both of them. ”MacGregor Marshall says that Sirindhorn underwent operations on both ankles at Chulalongkorn Hospital and is unlikely to walk again for several months. An announcement on Koi’s promotion to Thailand’s second queen is said to have been planned for Tuesday, her birthday.  In what may be a precursor to an official announcement later, the pair made a public appearance wearing matching blue coats as they released fish and birds in a Buddhist ceremony at Wasukri pier in Bangkok.  Contrary to a report in German newspaper Bild, an official announcement of her elevation has not yet been made. If Koi is indeed promoted to the position of queen, it would mark a remarkable comeback for the 35-year-old former nurse. Koi was only released from detention in August last year after spending ten months at a correctional facility.  She had been accused of feuding with the queen but was then declared “untainted” and restored to her role as 68-year-old King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s official consort. Just as rumors of her release were circulating, over a thousand photos of her, including alleged nudes, were sent on SD cards to MacGregor Marshall, and to Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a Thai academic and outspoken critic of the monarchy. The king only married his current and fourth wife, Suthida, in May 2019, just days before his coronation.  He divorced his third wife in 2014.  The relationship was made famous by a leaked video showing her feeding birthday cake to his poodle, Fufu, while she wore only a G-string and courtiers crawled on the floor before her and the king. Fufu featured in a previous embarrassing incident: Cables written by Eric John when he was U. S.  ambassador to Bangkok, which were published by Wikileaks, detailed the king’s strange obsession with the dog.  The diplomatic cables said he adored Fufu, and gave him the title air chief marshal.  He is said to have brought the dog to an official dinner “dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts” where he drank from guests’ water glasses. Thailand is battling a deep recession brought about by COVID-19 and the collapse of the pivotal tourist trade. Opponents of the ultra-rich royal family have been emboldened in recent months as rallies by student protesters against the establishment have seen their numbers swelling. Demonstrators have recently taken to protesting by wearing crop tops exposing their midriff to mock the king, who has been photographed wearing similar garb at airports and in German shopping centers. The protests have been inflamed by reports of the king’s vast wealth, estimated by London’s Financial Times at between $30 billion and $40 billion, after sovereign funds were effectively put under his direct control by the leaders of a successful 2014 coup. He is believed to be the world’s richest king. As The Daily Beast recently reported, Vajiralongkorn is also alleged to have built up an extraordinary fleet of 38 jets and helicopters for the exclusive use of the Thai royal family. He has spent much of the past few years living in Germany, most recently at the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmish-Partenkirchen, where his retinue of 20 concubines, who have all been given the same honorary surname, have also damaged his domestic and international reputation. Email addresses provided on Thai government websites did not work, with emails from The Daily Beast requesting comment bouncing back.  However, the Thai royals do not typically comment in response to press inquiries, in part because criticizing the royal family in the media is an offense under strict lèse majesté provisions of Thai law. At the latest count, according to a tally by news agency Prachatai, at least 55 people are now facing lèse majesté charges. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

S.  Securities and Exchange Commission said it is “actively monitoring” volatility in options and equities markets amid a surge in GameStop Corp.  and other companies over the past week that prompted Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren to demand action from regulators. “Consistent with our mission to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, we are working with our fellow regulators to assess the situation and review the activities of regulated entities, financial intermediaries, and other market participants,” the SEC said in a statement Wednesday. Retail investors have rapidly driven up GameStop’s shares in recent days, squeezing hedge funds with large short positions in the company, in a twist that has grabbed attention on Wall Street and in Washington. Shares in the video-game retailer more than doubled on Wednesday, triggering at least two volatility halts as it at one point notched its biggest-ever intraday advance.  GameStop has surged eightfold in the past week, adding almost $20 billion to its market value. The moves led Warren to pressure financial regulators to crack down on Wall Street, citing the frenzied activity. In a sharply worded statement earlier Wednesday, the Massachusetts Democrat and longtime corporate foe expressed astonishment at the rally while also criticizing hedge funds and others with short positions in company. ‘Personal Casino’“For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price,” Warren said.  “It’s long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs -- and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do. ”Warren’s comments came after White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Biden’s economic team were watching stock market activity around GameStop and other heavily shorted companies. “Our team is of course -- our economic team including Secretary Yellen and others -- are monitoring the situation,” Psaki told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.  She called the trading in the video-game retailer “a good reminder, though, that the stock market isn’t the only measure of the health of our economy. ”A Treasury Department spokesperson declined to comment.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also declined to weigh in on the activity around GameStop. “I don’t want to comment on a particular company or day’s market activity or things like that.  It’s just not something really that I would typically comment on,” he told reporters at a Wednesday afternoon news conference. Read More: GameStop Rally Hits New Extremes as Short Sellers SurrenderGameStop’s meteoric rise has captivated Wall Street, as an army of small traders spurred on by Reddit posts have pushed the company’s stock price to unheard-of levels.  Shares in the company began the year at just $19.  Hedge funds that held short positions in GameStop, such as Melvin Capital, have closed out of them as the rally continued, suffering billions of dollars in losses. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, said in a tweet that Wall Street and those posting online have taken a similar approach to the economy and markets. “Gotta admit it’s really something to see Wall Streeters with a long history of treating our economy as a casino complain about a message board of posters also treating the market as a casino,” she wrote. While some commentators have cast the frenzy as a populist uprising against Wall Street institutions, others see a dangerous play that could eventually leave investors exposed to major losses.  Some wondered if it was the result of purposeful market manipulation. Earlier: Michael Burry Calls GameStop Rally ‘Unnatural, Insane’ Investor Michael Burry, who previously championed GameStop in 2019, called the current phenomenon “unnatural, insane and dangerous. ”“What is going on now -- there should be legal and regulatory repercussions,” tweeted Burry, who made his name for his bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Burry’s tweet tagged the SEC’s Division of Enforcement.

(NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC).  Government And Regulators On Volatility: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration is ""monitoring the situation"" with GameStop, although no further details were made available.  Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman discussed the extreme volatility in stocks during a CNBC ""Squawk Box"" appearance Wednesday morning.  The Nasdaq exchange has technology in place that would facilitate a halt in stocks that are mentioned across social media platforms, she said.  GameStop is listed on the NYSE.  ""If we see a significant rise in the chatter on social media channels and we also match that up against unusual trading activity — we will potentially halt that stock. "" TD Ameritrade: Twitter user @SeaSalt posted a screenshot from brokerage TD Ameritrade that states: ""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities.  We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors. "" Charles Schwab, the parent company of TD Ameritrade as part of a $22-billion acquisition, told MarketWatch that it made changes to its margin requirements.  A spokeswoman said changes to how much capital an investor can borrow were enacted Jan.  13.  The statement said the brokerage has also placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities. "" Interactive Brokers: Other users on Twitter are reporting similar restrictions at rival brokerage firms, including Interactive Brokers.  One user, Tom George, wrote a Tweet that tagged Tesla CEO Elon Musk: ""Interactive Brokers is no longer accepting orders from GME, leaving millions of retail traders stuck.  This is so unfair, if there is anything you can do, please help.

2021-01-27 20:47:01#health#A universal influenza vaccine may be one step closer, bringing long-lasting protection against flu#https://news.yahoo.com/universal-influenza-vaccine-may-one-204701648.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_eYmHd.c62_mjC5IOqUnew--~B/aD0xMDYwO3c9MTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_us_articles_815/68946e0ed9bee010aff28781dca905ea#en#-0.3818#news.yahoo.com#Wouldn't it be nice if one shot could protect you for life? Bryan R.  Smith/AFP via Getty ImagesA bad year for flu can mean tens of thousands of deaths in the U. S.  Getting vaccinated can protect you from influenza, but you have to get the shot every year to catch up with the changing virus and to top up the short-lived immunity the vaccine provides.  The vaccine’s effectiveness also depends on correct predictions about which strains will be most common in a given season.  For these reasons, a one-and-done universal vaccine that would provide lasting immunity over multiple flu seasons and protect against a variety of strains has been a long-term goal for scientists.  Researchers are now one step closer to hitting that target.  Scientists recently completed the first human trial of a vaccine created by recombinant genetic technology to fool the immune system into attacking a part of the virus that does not change so fast and is common among different strains.  I am a microbiologist interested in infectious diseases, and I’ve followed the seasonal flu epidemic for several years.  I’m excited by this news, which could mark the turning point in the quest for a universal flu vaccine.  Here’s how it all works.  3D model of an influenza virus.  Its genetic material is inside, with proteins – HA in blue, NA in red – poking out from the surface.  Smith Collection/GadoArchive Photos via Getty Images Biology of the invading influenza virus Like the virus that causes COVID-19, the influenza virus has a protein shell that is coated by a lipid membrane.  Sticking through the membrane are multiple copies of three types of proteins: haemagglutinin, abbreviated as HA; neuraminidase, abbreviated as NA; and the matrix protein, M2.  It’s the properties of the HA and NA proteins that distinguish the different strains of the virus.  You’ve probably heard of strains like H1N1 and H3N2, both of which are infecting people in the U. S.  this year.  The HA molecule is shaped a bit like a flower bud, with a stalk and a head.  Once someone inhales the virus, the tip of the HA molecule’s head binds to a receptor on the surface of the cells that line the person’s respiratory passages.  This initial binding is crucial as it induces the cell to engulf the virus.  Once inside, the virus gets to work replicating its own genetic material.  But the enzyme that copies its single-strand RNA is very sloppy; it can leave two or three mistakes, called mutations, in every new copy.  Sometimes the genetic changes are so drastic that the progeny viruses don’t survive; other times they are the start of new flu strains.  Based on viral samples collected from around the world, the flu virus that arrives one year will have about seven new mutations in the gene for HA and four in the gene for NA compared to the previous year’s virus.  These differences are a big part of why the same influenza vaccine won’t be as effective from one year to the next.  Computer illustration of an immune cell (left) releasing many antibodies (white) to attack and disable invading flu particles.  Juan Gaertner/Science Photo Library via Getty Images Fighting off a flu infection When infected with the flu virus, your immune system produces antibodies to fend it off.  Most of these antibodies interact with the HA head and prevent the virus from getting into your cells.  But there’s a downside to that strong reaction.  Because the immune response to the virus’s head is so vigorous, it pays little attention to other parts of the virus.  That means that your immune system is not prepared to fend off any future infection with a virus that has a different HA head, even if the rest of the virus is identical.  Current flu vaccines are inactivated versions of the influenza virus and so also work by inducing antibodies targeted to the HA head.  And that’s why each version of the vaccine usually works only against a particular strain.  But, as the flu spreads, the rapid rate of genetic change can produce new versions of the HA head that will evade the antibodies induced by the vaccine.  These newly resistant viruses will then render even the current season’s vaccine ineffective.  The stalk portion of the HA molecule is much more genetically stable than the head.  And HA stalks from different flu strains are much more alike than their head regions are.  So, an obvious way to protect people against different flu strains would be to use just the HA stalk in a vaccine.  Unfortunately vaccination with only a headless stalk doesn’t seem to prevent infection.  Scientists are currently pursuing several different solutions to this problem.  A new kind of flu vaccine A team of scientists led by Florian Krammer at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai just completed the first human clinical trial of what they hope will be a universal flu vaccine.  The researchers used recombinant genetic technology to create flu viruses with “chimeric” HA proteins – essentially a patchwork quilt built from pieces of different flu strains.  Volunteers for the clinical trial received two vaccinations separated by three months.  The first dose consisted of an inactivated H1N1 virus with its original HA stalk but the head portion from a bird influenza virus.  Vaccination with this virus induced a mild antibody response to the foreign head, and a robust response to the stalk.  This pattern meant that the immune systems of the subjects had never encountered the head before, but had seen the stalk from previous flu vaccinations or infections.  The second vaccination consisted of the same H1N1 virus but with an HA head from a different bird virus.  This dose elicited, again, a mild antibody response to the new head, but a further boost in response to the HA stalk.  After each vaccine dose the subjects’ stalk antibody concentrations averaged about eight times higher than their initial levels.  Researchers found that even though the vaccine was based on the HA stalk of the H1N1 virus strain, the antibodies it elicited reacted to HA stalks from other strains too.  In lab tests, the antibodies from vaccinated volunteers attacked the H2N2 virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic and the H9N2 virus that the CDC considers to be of concern for future outbreaks.  The antibodies did not react to the stalk of the more distantly related H3 viral strain.  The antibody response also lasted a long time; after a year and a half, the volunteers still had about four times the concentration of antibodies to the HA stalk in their blood as when the trial started.  Avoiding the vigorous immune response to the protein’s head means the immune cells can concentrate on the more stable stalk of the protein.  Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images Since this was a phase 1 clinical trial testing only for adverse effects (which were minimal), the researchers didn’t expose vaccinated people to the flu to test if their new antibodies protected them.  However, they did inject the subjects’ blood serum, which contains the antibodies, into mice to see if it would protect them against the flu virus.  Getting a shot of serum taken from volunteers a month after receiving the booster shot, when antibody levels were high, led to mice being 95% healthier after virus exposure than mice who got blood serum from nonvaccinated volunteers.  Even the mice who received serum that was collected from vaccinated volunteers a year after the start of the trial were about 30% less sick.  These results show that vaccination with a chimeric flu protein can provide long-lasting immunity to several different strains of the influenza virus.  Scientists will need to continue optimizing this approach so it works for different types and strains of influenza.  But the success of this first human trial means you may one day get a single shot and, at last, be free from the flu.

In fact, the only two inaugurations to draw more viewers were Ronald Reagan's first inaugural in 1981, watched by 41. 8 million viewers, and Barack Obama's 2009 swearing-in, with 37. 8 million people watching.  Biden's 33. 8 million viewers easily topped Trump's 30. 6 million, Nielsen said.  More people watched Trump's inauguration on Fox News, though.  The network saw a 77 percent decline in viewers for Biden's ceremony versus Trump's.  CNN more than made up for the difference — its inaugural coverage was the No.  8 show in all of prime time last week, Nielsen said.  In the cable wars, CNN came in first last week, followed by MSNBC and then Fox News.  Trump, if he were bothered about getting lower ratings than Biden, might take a little bit of solace in the fact that more people attended his inauguration in person four years ago.

And then some? Wall Street analysts did.  A consensus sees Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) as joining that rarefied corporate crowd that’s broken the $100 billion in quarterly revenues mark when it opens the books Wednesday on its fiscal Q1.  That’s a record for AAPL, of course, and may have been assisted by holiday sales of its new iPhone 12.  But it’s one in a series of fresh peaks AAPL has scored in a year—one the company acknowledged was rocked by adversity in many corners.  Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the strong results in last quarter’s report were driven by “the unmatched loyalty of our customers. ” That may or not be true, but when AAPL reports earnings, investors also will be listening to how well AAPL is playing the market share game.  The work-from-home trend, fueled by the pandemic, looks like it might have been a game-changer for AAPL, according to Morningstar analysts who believe it powered sales of iPads, desktops, and laptops.  All that could be overshadowed in fiscal Q1 by iPhone 12 holiday sales, which it’s probably safe to say will get a fair share of attention Wednesday afternoon following the closing bell.  AAPL has always been an attention-getter when earnings season rolls around, and now, with it sporting a $2. 34 trillion market cap and reaching new stock price highs, it looks like it’s sure to take a spot under the limelight even when it’s up against a host of other high-profile tech stocks earnings results this week.  Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Facebook, Inc.  (NASDAQ: FB) report the same afternoon.  The Numbers Wall Street analysts expect AAPL revenue to jump 12% year-over-year to about $103 billion, according to FactSet.  But some firms, such as Loup Ventures, are looking for much stronger numbers: up 19% to $109. 5 billion.  From an earnings perspective, the Street has reached a consensus of $1. 41 a share.  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is also forecasting on the high side of consensus, eyeing revenues of $108. 2 billion and earnings per share of $1. 50.  “Our recent conversations suggest investors expect Apple to release solid, but not great, December quarter results,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent report.  “We disagree and believe that Apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings.  “In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple’s most successful product launch in the last five years,” they said.  More on that later.  Any way you look at it, the numbers look robust.  The Innovation Machine AAPL stopped giving guidance last year—kind of like many other companies uncertain of the ramifications of COVID-19 on their sales.  In March, no one knew what the ricochet effects of the pandemic might be or how long it might last.  We still don’t know all of that, but we have found that the city- and state-mandated quarantines and the overall fear of being in public helped fast-forward many trends that were already picking up steam.  The digital transformation sped up, and it looks like AAPL might have been well-positioned for it.  While the iPhone 12 might get most of the attention Wednesday, think back to last quarter when CEO Tim Cook noted all-time records for Mac and Services.  Though he didn’t offer guidance for this past quarter per se, he did suggest double-digit gains on all product categories except the iPhone 12, which he thought would reach single-digit gains.  FIGURE 1: APPLE LEAVES INDEX IN THE DUST.  Over the last year, shares of Apple (AAPL—candlestick) have easily outpaced the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX—purple line).  Apple shares got off to a quick start in 2021, with investors apparently enthusiastic about tomorrow’s Q1 earnings prospects.  Data source: Nasdaq.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade.  For illustrative purposes only.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  The Mighty iPhone 5G Launch Despite all the happy talk about fiscal Q4 revenues, iPhone’s weaker-than-expected sales offset the glee and pulled shares down nearly 6% in the first couple of days after the October earnings release.  They have since recovered.  AAPL reported iPhone sales of $26. 4 billion in fiscal Q4, below the $27. 73 billion expected by the Street.  Much of that shortfall was attributed to AAPL’s decision to push the iPhone 12 launch into this most recent quarter, a move many believe may have led to consumers waiting for the upgrade before they bought.  Back then, some analysts said a move to 5G could end up being a tailwind for the iPhone 12 with sales promotions and subscription services bundles.  That, combined with the important holiday shopping season about to begin, could have led to a fast start for the new phone.  We’ll see now if they were right.  Analysts are mostly bullish on their iPhone sales expectations, with some saying the delay might have pushed around $4 billion in iPhone sales to the December quarter from the fiscal Q3.  The Street’s consensus last stood at $59. 58 billion, up better than 6% on a year-over-year basis.  But Loup Ventures thinks that’s conservative.  It’s looking for sales to vault 16% on a year-over-year basis to $64. 9 billion, jumping to 59% of total sales compared with the iPhone’s typical 50% of sales standing.  It’s unclear if that will actually be the case, but if it is it would reverse a trend in recent years toward iPhones being less of AAPL’s total revenue.  The company has been emphasizing growth in services.  Remember, we’re just two years out from January 2019 when Cook sent a letter to AAPL investors warning of a fiscal Q1 earnings shortfall due in part to weak iPhone sales in China.  How things have changed.  AAPL Earnings And Options Activity AAPL is expected to report an adjusted EPS of $1. 41, up from $1. 25 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates.  Revenue is projected at $103. 01 billion, up 16. 4% from a year ago.  The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 6. 2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.  Looking at the Jan.  29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 125 and 135 strikes.  But it’s been dwarfed by activity to the upside, heavy call volume at the 145 and 150 strikes.  The implied volatility sits at the 34th percentile as of Tuesday morning.  Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Home Work And Its Tools The work- and study-from-home phenomenon helped drive sales of Macs and iPads last year, and analysts widely expect that trend continued into the fiscal Q1.  A number of bells and whistles were added to new iPads and iPad Airs, and new computers with AAPL’s custom M1 chip replacing the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) chip also hit the market.  AAPL also is reportedly working on a new iPad Pro expected to be released in mid-March.  There’s also talk on Wall Street that AAPL might have patented a new version of the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro.  Given Cook’s comments about the “most prolific product introduction period,” analysts widely expect to hear about other new products coming on line.  An update of the MacBook Air is one of those possible developments.  AAPL is working on a thinner and lighter version of the MacBook Air, Bloomberg reported late last week, citing “people with knowledge of the matter.  Analysts said they want to know if the planned release in the second half of this year is on track.  Analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.  expect AAPL to shed light on several new products and services, including how sales are going for its $549 AirPods Max over-the-ear headphones and the subscription Apple Fitness+ offering, plus ways to bundle services together for a discount.  “In our view, Apple’s portfolio was positioned better-than-ever heading into the recent holiday season, while product and service updates position Planet Apple well in 2021,” the team wrote.  And So Much More Among the myriad reasons AAPL’s earnings are such a magnet goes beyond products Other factors underscoring the company’s progress range from privacy concerns to app developer fees to government interventions and the overall economy.  AAPL has done much to address many of these issues, but each quarter tends to introduce a fresh crop.  In November, for example, AAPL said it would cut in half the commissions it charges smaller developers who sell software through the App Store and generate under $1 million in sales.  AAPL’s original 30% take has long fueled complaints from developers, users and governments over its dominance in the digital world.  The price cut to 15% appeased some but not all stakeholders and analysts hope the company will address how the cuts are panning out in the beginning weeks.  Another question heading into earnings is AAPL’s cash position.  The total cash trove stood at roughly $192 billion at the end of the company’s fiscal Q4, with about $112 billion in debt and a little more than $79 billion in cash.  AAPL returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.  Investors can expect to continue to see more of that ahead, according to Loup Ventures, which estimates an additional $73 billion will be returned in coming years.

2021-01-26 17:08:03#tech#Now you can play The Elder Scrolls in an Elder Scrolls chair, wearing your Elder Scrolls ring#https://www.pcgamer.com/now-you-can-play-the-elder-scrolls-in-an-elder-scrolls-chair-wearing-your-elder-scrolls-ring/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R23joDnAoYiMSi8jPbFLGX-1200-80.png#en#0.34#www.pcgamer.com#"The Elder Scrolls games take place in the world of Tamriel, and key to this universe is chairs.  Just you try caning Skyrim from a standing position.  In a rather obvious brand tie-up, there is now an Elder Scrolls Online-themed chair coming from Noblechairs, a company whose sedentary solutions apparently ""combine the latest ergonomics and sports-inspired design. ""(To be fair, it does look a bit sportier than this unfortunate customer.  We're still waiting to find out the reason behind the Twitch ban. )What is there to say about a chair? Perhaps now is the time to invoke the theory of forms, Plato's notion that, even if all the chairs in the world were to be destroyed, there would still remain an inviolable, timeless idea of the chair in the human mind.  All objects are mere imitations of this ideal chair.  Who is to say that this The Elder Scrolls Online is not very close to that essence, that soul of a chair?The chair is based on Noblechairs' existing HERO model, which we reckon is the best gaming chair around for back support.  This design is ""now merged with premium grade black and gold PU leather, gold stitching and high-detail embroidered artwork"" (PU or polyurethane leather is an artificial leather). You can sign up here to be notified when the chair is available.  No price is listed, but the chair type is the modestly-named HERO which usually clocks in at around $500 (as it did for an old Fallout tie-in).  Next to an Elder Scrolls wedding ring that costs a cool grand, this looks like a snip.

The new computer is planned to be released during the second half of this year at the earliest or in 2022.  It will include Apple’s MagSafe charging technology and a next-generation version of the company’s in-house Mac processors.  Apple has discussed making the laptop smaller by shrinking the border around the screen, which will remain 13-inches.  The current model weighs 2. 8 pounds and is just over half an inch at its thickest point.  The company considered building a larger version of the MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen, but Apple isn’t moving forward with this for the next generation, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. MagSafe, which was removed from the MacBook Air with its 2018 redesign, is a magnetic charging system.  That means any accidental yanking of the power cable would simply detach it from the laptop rather than pull down the entire computer.  The new model will have a pair of USB 4 ports for connecting external devices.  The new laptop is destined to be a higher-end version of the current MacBook Air, which is expected to remain in the company’s lineup as an entry-level offering.  Apple last updated the product in November with its own M1 Mac chip, replacing a processor from Intel Corp.  The Mac is Apple’s oldest product line and has a loyal following.  A few years ago, the company was criticized for not updating these computers enough and not paying attention to customer demands.  Now, there’s a flood of updates coming.  In addition to the new MacBook Air, Apple is planning its biggest update to the MacBook Pro since 2016, the first redesign of the iMac in nearly a decade, a new Intel-based Mac Pro, and a half-sized Mac Pro desktop with in-house chips. The upcoming MacBook Pro is an example of Apple’s renewed focus on Mac loyalists.  The company is planning to bring back an SD card slot for the next MacBook Pros so users can insert memory cards from digital cameras.  That feature was removed in 2016, to the consternation of professional photographers and video creators, key segments of the MacBook Pro user base.  The heavily criticized Touch Bar, the current model’s touchscreen function row, is also going.  Apple has also developed underlying Mac support for both cellular connectivity — the ability for Macs to connect to the internet via smartphone networks — and Face ID, the company’s facial recognition system.  But neither feature appears to be coming soon.  To that end, Face ID had originally been planned to arrive in this year’s iMac redesign, but it’s now unlikely to be included in the first iteration of the new design.

2021-01-26 14:05:54#business#Tesla, BMW Approved for Slice of $3.5 Billion EU Battery Aid#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-bmw-approved-slice-3-134013171.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F_o7xdbFbCeYM1V1SsTreQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/96b09f9a622d3139018f9022cf360dd0#en#0.4215#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- The European Union paved the way for companies including Tesla Inc.  and BMW AG to get about 2. 9 billion euros ($3. 5 billion) of state aid for battery projects that will strengthen the bloc’s position in the race to produce more electric vehicles. The European Commission expects the support to trigger more than three times as much private investment, bringing the total spent to about 12 billion euros.  The aid will go to 42 companies across a dozen countries, with beneficiaries also including Fiat Chrysler owner Stellantis NV and startup Northvolt AB. The 27-nation bloc plans to slash greenhouse gas emissions from transport under the European Green Deal, an ambitious economic overhaul aimed at reaching climate neutrality by 2050.  Along the way, the EU wants to reduce its reliance on EV batteries from Asian producers.  The value of Europe’s battery market will reach 250 billion euros by 2025 and meet demands from the auto industry, according to the commission. “Europe will cement in this way its position as a global hot spot for battery investment,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said.  “This pan-European project will help revolutionize the battery market. ”More information about the amount of aid going to each project will be available in the public version of the Commission’s decision once it has agreed with member states and third parties on any confidential business secrets that need to be removed. Aid for the projects, which are expected to be completed by 2028, will be disbursed by countries including Finland, Spain, France and Poland, and was coordinated by Germany.  It follows a 3. 2 billion-euro package to support a total of 9 billion euros of public and private spending that was coordinated by France and approved in December 2019. Pouring InBattery investment has poured in as Europe’s stricter pollution standards forces carmakers to embrace electric cars and limit carbon-dioxide emissions.  BloombergNEF is forecasting 1. 9 million sales of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles in Europe this year, topping China and almost quadrupling the total expected in North America. As part of the Green Deal, the EU wants to toughen its 2030 emissions-reduction target to at least 55% from 1990 levels, compared with the existing goal of a 40% cut.  The overhaul is a key pillar of the region’s strategy to recover from the virus-induced recession. European policy makers are aware the bloc’s key industries risk falling behind if they don’t fill manufacturing gaps in energy-storage technology.  Lithium-ion batteries will power plug-in cars and also help balance electric grids transmitting renewable energy including wind and solar. The battery initiative announced Tuesday got priority status as an Important Project of Common European Interest, or IPCEI.  It will involve research and development of new technologies to reduce or completely eliminate cobalt or natural graphite and replace it with synthetics. The projects will cover the entire battery value chain, from extraction of raw materials, design and manufacturing of battery cells and packs, and recycling and disposal.  The aid is expected to contribute to development of technological breakthroughs, including different cell chemistries, novel production processes and other innovations. Tesla’s AmbitionsTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the electric-car maker plans to add a battery-cell production facility at the vehicle-assembly plant it’s building near Berlin.  The site will initially have capacity of more than 100 gigawatt-hours a year and eventually ramp up to as much as 250 gigawatt-hours, Musk said during a battery conference in November. “I’m pretty confident at that point it would be the largest battery-cell plant in the world,” Musk said.  He didn’t give time frames for when he expects the facility to reach those capacity levels. The factory Tesla is building in the small town of Gruenheide will be the company’s first in Europe.  It’s slated to start making vehicle in the middle of this year and eventually assemble as many as 500,000 cars annually.  While construction is far along, the company is still awaiting final approval for the project from local authorities.  It also has been hung up by environmental groups’ legal challenges. Other carmakers investing in European battery production include PSA Group, which merged with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis.  It set up a joint venture called Automotive Cells Company with French oil giant Total SA’s Saft unit in September.  Sweden’s Northvolt will operate a plant with Volkswagen AG in Germany, with BMW also participating in the project and ordering billions’ worth of batteries from the startup. Asian battery giants including South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. , Japan’s Panasonic Corp.  and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.  Ltd.  also have said they’re going to set up or expand operations in the region.

What Happened: The hedge fund manager aired his displeasure at the short squeeze on Twitter.  If I put $GME on your radar, and you did well, I’m genuinely happy for you.  However, what is going on now – there should be legal and regulatory repercussions.  This is unnatural, insane, and dangerous.  @SEC_Enforcement — Cassandra (@michaeljburry) January 27, 2021 Burry also tagged the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement arm in his Twitter post.  The physician-investor is known for “The Big Short,” a film in which he was played by Christian Bale.  The movie is based on his bet against the US housing market.  Why It Matters: Burry owned 1. 7 million GameStop shares worth $17 million at the end of September, reported Business Insider.  The shares would be now worth $250 million, which is a 1,400% increase, as of Tuesday’s close.  GameStop shares surged over 41. 5% in the after-hours session after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted “Gamestonk!!” on Tuesday.  Musk also included a link to the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets that has pushed the retailer’s shares higher and put pressure on short sellers.  See Also: GameStop's Power Surge: Will WallStreetBets Or The Short Sellers Come Out On Top? As of Tuesday’s closing, GameStop shares have returned 678. 84% since the beginning of the year, Price Action: GameStop shares closed 92. 71% at $147. 98 on Tuesday and spiked 41. 58% in the after-hours session to $209. 51.

Both vaccines produced lower levels of coronavirus antibodies than have been found in the blood of individuals who recovered from natural COVID-19 infections.  For reference, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines produced antibody levels several times higher than natural infections. The unsuccessful trials are disappointing in large part because both Merck vaccines would have required just one dose, writes Stat.  One of the candidates, which uses the same virus as the one in Merck's successful Ebola vaccine, was being developed in partnership with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which has said it will try to determine if using an oral or intranasal administration route will work better than the current intramuscular injection.  It's unclear if Merck will continue to collaborate — IAVI's president Mark Feinberg told Stat he hopes they do — because the pharmaceutical company has suggested it will now turn its focus to developing COVID-19 therapeutics. As Stat notes, the results show just how difficult vaccine development can be, especially in such a short amount of time, making the rapid success of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots seem all the more remarkable.

The company's burger patties and sausages have been among the leaders in the surge in interest in plant-based alternatives over the past two years as consumers worried about their health, animal welfare and food safety.  The new partnership will give the plant-based meat maker access to the beverage giant's distribution and marketing resources and allow it to expand into new product lines, Beyond Meat Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said. #https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-beyond-meat-partner-develop-133608887.html#cHUyBVwkU

The stock climbed as much as 32% at the open on Tuesday, putting its market capitalization at about $7 billion and making GameStop worth more than the likes of Perrigo Co. , Apache Corp. , Leggett & Platt Inc. , and Hanesbrands Inc.  It surpassed insurance-provider Unum Group, HollyFrontier Corp. , and Flowserve Corp.  on Monday. The video-game retailer has climbed about 400% this year with traders piling into the stock after activist investor and Chewy Inc.  co-founder Ryan Cohen joined its board earlier this month.  Options trading has also surged with retail investors ramping up bets on even more upside. The stock’s surge has in part been fueled by an army of Reddit-charged day traders who used the website’s WallStreetBets forum to pump up shares and fight back against the eye-popping levels of short interest.  Bets by Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital and Andrew Left’s Citron Research have faced a reckoning in the battle with GameStop’s retail fans. Hedge fund titans Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen boosted Melvin Capital, according to a statement on Monday, injecting a total of $2. 75 billion into the firm after it lost about 30% this year.  The capital infusion came after Melvin Capital, which started the year with about $12. 5 billion in assets, saw short bets, including GameStop, go awry, people familiar with the firm said.

For all the transformation still undergoing Fortnite, 2017 feels like too small a distance for a game to have gone from rumored vaporware to global phenomenon.  I scored the earliest version of Fortnite a 55 at the time, a clearly troubled project that Epic Games just needed to get out after spinning its wheels in development purgatory.  Fortnite would either take on new life in the hands of players or fizzle out and die of natural causes.  It happens.  But just as the battle royale craze spun up in the wake of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' surprise success, Epic pulled an historic U-turn and put out Fortnite: Battle Royale, then a simple spin-off developed in three months.  Over time Fortnite's improvisational development helped establish a modern vocabulary for live games with in-game events, battle passes, and consistent seasonal cycles.  Fortnite saw the rise of Ninja and mainstream Twitch celebrity at large, it saw Epic try out bonkers marketing stunts like the complete shutdown of Fortnite for a few days just to generate awareness and usher in Chapter 2.  Fortnite became such a cultural, money-printing force that Epic went as far as to abandon the iOS platform as a form of protest over ""monopolistic practices,"" even accompanying the move with a parody of Apple's own 1984-inspired Macintosh ad.  And now, in 2021, Fortnite is still trucking along, still making stuff up on the fly, but it's settled into a more comfortable rhythm.  Fortnite is a battle royale toy box without a bottom, and with every recognizable character and brand waiting for their turn in the item shop.  Even if you've played before, look away for a second and Fortnite will take on a totally new look when you turn back.  So let's take a look at the state of Fortnite in 2021 and try to guess how this megagame might transform further. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-fortnite-in-2021/#SDAkTnn1r

The Schitt's Creek star shared her plans to sell the dress to the highest bidder on Jan.  21, and noted that 100 percent of proceeds will go to charity.  ""This was the very first thing I wore on my very first red carpet (the Canadian Screen Awards in 2015) so yeah, there might be anxiety sweat in the armpits, but there are pockets in the dress, so it balances out,"" she captioned an Instagram post.  ""I would very much like to sell it to you if you're in the market. "" The proceeds from the dress will be evenly split between two charities, including Encampment Support Network, a volunteer-run network that helps individuals living in tent encampments across Toronto.  Murphy will enlist the help of her followers to choose the second charity (Canadian or American) to support.  As a seasoned trend setter, Murphy knows that we shop with our eyes, but she threw in a few key details about the dress to make it even more appealing to potential bidders.  Highlights of the elegant gown include: ""It's black. "" ""It has pockets. "" ""It's made by evening wear brand Wayne Clark Designs. "" ""It is sweaty in and around the armpit area. "" ""It's a size 4. "" ""There's a big ol 'v' in the front so your skin can pop out of there. "" ""It's very nice. "" Interested in expanding your wardrobe to reflect a little more of the true style icon behind Alexis Rose? Anyone willing to donate a sizeable amount to charity can email Murphy at csadress69@gmail. com.  She'll only respond to the highest bidders, so this might be the time to gather up the gang and have everyone chip in on the most squeal-worthy of dresses, as Alexis might say.  Take a closer look at Murphy's evening gown from the 2015 Canadian Screen Awards here.

Any doubts about the location of the new game have been dispelled by the recently released BioWare: Stories and Secrets from 25 Years of Game Development, a book celebrating the studio's 25th anniversary with art, pictures, commentary, and stories.  Tom Phillips of Eurogamer scored himself a copy, and found an official confirmation inside. ""As BioWare entered its twenty-fifth year, the Dragon Age team was hard at work on Morrison, the code name of the long-awaited follow-up to Dragon Age: Inquisition,"" an entry on page 324 called ""Tevinter Bound: A sneak peek at the follow-up to Inquisition"" states. ""The game, helmed by executive producer Mark Darrah, will take players to Tevinter as the events of Inquisition and Trespasser threaten to forever change Thedas.
