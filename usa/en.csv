Arsonists attacked several public buildings in Panguipulli late on Friday including the municipal headquarters, which was still smoldering early on Saturday.  Wider protests since late 2019 have put the country's Carabinero police force under intense scrutiny, with local and international watchdog groups alleging excessive use of force and human rights violations. #https://news.yahoo.com/protests-erupt-chilean-lakeside-resort-170554737.html#SrlqxhCOP

The agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras required many migrants who showed up at the U. S. –Mexico border to seek asylum in one of those countries first.  The deals with El Salvador and Honduras were never formally enacted, and the agreement with Guatemala has been effectively on hold since March due to the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be clear, these actions do not mean that the U. S.  border is open.  While we are committed to expanding legal pathways for protection and opportunity here and in the region, the United States is a country with borders and laws that must be enforced,” Blinken said in the statement.  “We are also committed to providing safe and orderly processing for all who arrive at our border, but those who attempt to migrate irregularly are putting themselves and their families at risk on what can be a very dangerous journey,” he added.  President Biden is looking to undo other aspects of the Trump administration’s stringent immigration enforcement policies as well.  Last week, the Biden administration announced the return of the so-called “catch and release” policy at the southern border, a practice President Trump had issued an order to stop.  U. S.  Customs and Border Protection is reimplementing the Obama-era policy of releasing newly-apprehended migrants back into U. S.  cities along the South Texas border, citing coronavirus concerns at detention facilities as well as the rising numbers of apprehended migrants. #https://news.yahoo.com/biden-end-trump-asylum-deals-151224237.html#xJy3JbtVg

Starting Tuesday, trading links via Hong Kong’s exchange operator allowing mainland traders to buy domestic stocks will halt through Feb.  17 due to the Lunar New Year holiday.  The stock connect closure will slam the brakes on record levels of inflows that helped propel Hong Kong’s equities market to its best start to a year since 1985. Investors north of the border turned bargain hunters in late 2020 after valuations in some sectors onshore reached the highest in more than a decade.  Mainland investors net bought nearly $48 billion worth of Hong Kong stocks in the first five weeks of this year, which is already more than half of 2020’s total.  They continued buying the city’s stocks on Monday, with net purchases at HK$12 billion ($1. 5 billion). “We think it might be worthwhile to take some profit ahead of the trading link halt for stocks that are heavily boosted by southbound investors” including Tencent Holdings Ltd. , Meituan and China Merchants Bank Co Ltd, said Zhuang Jiapeng, a fund manager at Shenzhen JM Capital Co. Still, the incentive to take money out of the market is low given that people swapping investment ideas during the holidays could spur further gains when the links with Shenzhen and Shanghai reopen.  Zhuang said he’s considering moving all of his fund’s assets into Hong Kong at some point later this year, compared with his current 70% exposure. While the shutting of the links for the Lunar New Year is an annual occurrence, traders are taking a closer look given this year’s unprecedented inflows.  Tencent, for example, has seen southbound turnover via the links account for about 42% of the stock’s average daily turnover so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The financial hub is the venue for an increasing number of hot startup listings and tech giants, including short-video platform Kuaishou Technology, which debuted on Friday.  Tencent Music Entertainment Group has selected banks to arrange its planned second listing in the city. “Hong Kong stocks will remain attractive to mainlanders while outperformers in A-shares have skyrocketed and valuations are insane,” said Dai Ming, a fund manager at Hengsheng Asset Management Co.  “We are still just at the beginning of a long-term buying trend for Hong Kong stocks. ”(Updates southbound flows for Monday in paragraph 3)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

2021-02-08 10:34:58#business#SoftBank’s Vision Fund Posts Record $8 Billion Profit on IPO Boom#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-vision-fund-posts-record-070050936.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gxnsb4TqtEqV4SFQNwyW5g--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/c23fd483010891e744254078024eda99#en#0.5994#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp.  reported a record profit in its Vision Fund as a surging stock market lifted the value of its portfolio companies, but founder Masayoshi Son wiped out a significant chunk of those gains with his controversial trading in derivatives. The Vision Fund reported a 844. 1 billion yen ($8 billion) profit in the December quarter, surpassing record numbers set just a quarter earlier.  A global rally in technology shares has boosted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc.  and paved the way for initial public offerings from the likes of DoorDash Inc. Those gains, which had been widely expected, were offset by fallout from Son’s decision last year to start dabbling in trading stocks and options.  SoftBank posted a 285. 3 billion yen derivatives loss in the period.  That led to an overall loss in the asset management arm of 113. 5 billion yen, up from 85. 2 billion yen in the previous three-month period. “The Vision Fund’s stellar performance in the past few quarters continues to cover for the losses on options trading,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.  “SoftBank could argue those derivatives were for hedging purposes, but Son’s venture into trading is definitely not looking good so far. ”In a presentation to investors after the results, Son focused on his successes.  He reprised his argument that SoftBank is like a goose that lays golden eggs, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and Yahoo! two decades ago, to companies like Uber and DoorDash more recently.  Some 15 companies have gone public from the Vision Fund so far, he said. “Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,” he said, pacing a stage in a white turtleneck sweater and grey jacket.  “We are finally in the harvesting stage. ”He said Vision Fund 1 and Vision Fund 2 have invested in a total of 131 companies.  In the case of DoorDash, SoftBank invested about $680 million for a stake now worth about $9 billion, he said, while its $7. 7 billion investment in Uber is worth $11. 3 billion. The Tokyo-based company had a net income of 1. 17 trillion yen in the December period and did not release operating profit figures.  At least six more portfolio companies are planning IPOs this year. “There is a lot of liquidity out there and investors are particularly partial toward tech stocks,” Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore.  “At some point the IPO fatigue sets in, but doesn’t seem like we are there yet.  For now, the window of opportunity is open for SoftBank. ”After shares plunged in March with the coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank unveiled plans to sell off 4. 5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and fund buybacks.  The selloff included part of its interests in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc.  and SoftBank Corp. , the Japan telecommunications unit.  SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd.  to Nvidia Corp.  for $40 billion. SoftBank held a total of $22 billion of “highly liquid listed stocks” as of the end of quarter, including a $7. 39 billion investment in Amazon. com Inc. , $3. 28 billion in Facebook Inc.  and $1. 38 billion in Alphabet Inc.  The operation is managed by its asset management subsidiary SB Northstar, where Son personally holds a 33% stake. The investments were accompanied by derivatives that amplified exposure, but SoftBank has been winding down its options strategy amid a backlash from investors.  The fair value of SoftBank’s futures and options positions came to little over $1 billion at the end of December, compared with $2. 7 billion the previous quarter.  Long call options on listed stocks have dwindled to $1. 68 billion from $4. 69 billion and short call options on listed stocks declined to $238 million from $1. 26 billion of value. Son said that the losses in the asset management arm have swung to a profit of about 100 billion yen since the end of last quarter.  But the operations remain in a “test-drive stage,” he said. Alibaba, Son’s most stark investment success to date and SoftBank’s largest asset, saw its shares plunge about 20% last quarter amid a Chinese government clampdown that scuttled the planned listing of its affiliate Ant Group Co.  Founder Jack Ma had all but vanished from public view, prompting investor unease before he resurfaced last month. Son said he remained in touch with Ma, without giving specific details of their communications.  He said Ma likes to draw and shares his drawings with Son via chat; the SoftBank chief also sketches but hasn’t shared any of his work.  Son also said he saw the increased antitrust scrutiny of Ma’s businesses in China as part of the country’s natural evolution. SoftBank’s own sale of Arm to Nvidia is still making its way through the approval process gauntlet.  The United Kingdom and European Union are both preparing to launch probes into the deal, the Financial Times reported last week.  Son said he remained confident that it will receive a green light at the end. SoftBank has also joined the blank-check company frenzy with plans for several special purpose acquisition companies.  SVF Investment Corp.  raised $525 million last month to address sectors like mobile communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud technologies and software.  LDH Growth Corp I plans to raise as much as $200 million to target Latin American and Hispanic markets. SoftBank last week filed for two more SPACs, seeking to raise another $630 million.  The new SoftBank vehicles, SVF Investment Corp.  2 and 3, will target the same diverse areas of technology as the first, including mobile communications and artificial intelligence, according to filings Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Consistently good performance by Vision Fund portfolio companies also helps the SPAC’s prospects because investors can extrapolate management expertise,” said Tang at United First Partners.  “It underlines their skill in deploying capital. ”SoftBank may see between 10 to 20 public listings a year from its portfolio of 164 startups across three different funds, Son said.  A typical early-stage venture capital fund might see a third of its bets pay off, but SoftBank’s portfolio of late-stage companies should do better than that, he said.  Even WeWork has received SPAC interest, he said. The billionaire struck a tone that was reminiscent of the days before the WeWork fiasco in late 2019.  He said the key to turning “white egg” investments into golden egg hits was “turbo-charging” startups with “overwhelming capital,” more ambitious goals and synergies with other portfolio companies. Son’s presentation then took a turn for the comical.  He flipped to an animated slide of a goose tagged with “AI revolution” text and a line of golden eggs marching out of its backside to Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker. “Investment is a rhythm,” Son said.  “But please don’t look at this too seriously. ”(Updates with Son’s comments on Alibaba, derivatives from 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

2021-02-08 13:15:38#business#Palantir Teams Up With IBM, Sending Its Shares Soaring#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-teams-ibm-opening-path-103000378.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pPs869gx3_MARAc7gO4C0w--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b72485e22588ce881bfb70ddb7700579#en#0.29600000000000004#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc.  and International Business Machines Corp.  are uniting in a partnership that will dramatically expand the reach of Palantir’s sales force while making IBM’s own artificial-intelligence software easier for non-technical customers to use, the companies plan to announce Monday. The global partnership is the largest of its kind for Palantir, the maker of data-analysis software whose shares have more than quadrupled since its September debut on the New York Stock Exchange.  Palantir gains access to a sales team of more than 2,500 people, up from its current 30.  Palantir’s stock rose as much as 12% in pre-market trading. The relationship is the payday for the project Palantir started more than a year ago to break its data integration and analysis software into smaller, less pricey modules.  The Denver-based company mainly mainly sells to companies with revenue in excess of $500 million -- many of which already have relationships with IBM. Reselling Palantir’s software to augment the data and AI tools that IBM already offers and make them easier for more people to use was “a natural” fit, said Rob Thomas, IBM’s senior vice president of software, cloud and data.  “We’re going to sell it to 180 countries and thousands of customers. ”Palantir’s software requires little to no coding, enabling less technical employees to use it, Thomas said.  To expand IBM’s cloud and AI business, half the revenue will need to come through partnerships like the one struck with Palantir.  “That’s a pretty fundamental change for us,” he said. Expanded AccessWithout providing a time frame, Thomas said he expects the partnership to help boost IBM’s customers using AI to 80% from its current 20%. Palantir Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said the technical fit with IBM and its reach are part of his company’s long-term effort to finally ramp sales.  In addition to commercial customers, government contracts have surged both in number and size during the pandemic. “This is the biggest [partnership[ we’ve announced -- expect more,” Sankar said.  He said he expects to triple Palantir’s direct-sales team to about 100 this year, a significant hike for a company whose management once prided itself on not employing a single salesperson. Started with funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel in 2003, Palantir found early success with users at the U. S.  Central Intelligence Agency and went on to sign the Defense Department and Internal Revenue Service, which, respectively, have used the software to locate roadside bombs and hunt tax cheats. Government ContractsMore recently the U. S.  Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention use Palantir’s software to help predict Covid-19 outbreaks, distribute protective gear and allocate vaccines. While Palantir’s government contracts have grown -- sometimes amid privacy and surveillance concerns -- the company’s commercial business has been slower to evolve. Palantir last reported 132 total government and commercial clients, a concentrated pool that includes BP Plc, Merck KGaA and Airbus SE.  Early customers like American Express Co.  and Coca-Cola Co.  which experimented with low-cost Palantir software trials and later ditched them, aren’t necessarily top of Palantir’s list now, Sankar said. “We hope to win all this business back in the fullness of time,” Sankar said, adding there is no “pride list” of former customers it hopes to now re-engage. Palantir reports financial results for 2020 on Feb.  16.  A shareholder lockup expires three days later, unleashing the remaining 80% of all shares that have not been eligible to trade.  Palantir shares rose $2 to $34. 05 on Feb.  5, giving it a stock-market value of $59. 3 billion.

The patch was previously announced at the Final Fantasy 14 showcase, where CEO Yosuke Matsuda 'accidentally' let slip the patch's release date, but with no additional details. Patch 5. 5, dubbed Death Unto Dawn, will be split into two parts, with the second half arriving in May.  Across the two parts, patch 5. 5 will release new Main Scenario Quests tying up the Shadowbringers storyline and paving the way for Endbringer's release sometime this autumn.  The first half also brings the third chapter of the Nier crossover alliance raid, YorHa: Dark Apocalypse.   New trials are also on the way.  The Cloud Deck Trial will introduce the Diamond Weapon, available in both normal and extreme difficulties.  There's also a new Unreal Trial, though we don't know which primal will be featured this time. The main story quests also bring the dungeon Paglth'an, which can be completed in a party or using the Trust System.  And across the game, all level 70 dungeons will be available in Explorer Mode—letting players dive into an enemy-less instance.  You'll be able to whip out your instrument of choice in Explorer Mode too, thanks to the added ability to use performance actions.  You'll also be able to change instruments at any time while performing, with a brand new mystery musical contraption on the way. The Sorrow or Werlyt and Save the Queen questlines are getting updates, along with a new zone called Zadnor.  The relic weapons are also getting their final upgrades, likely increasing the item level cap.  There'll be some general job adjustments, new mounts, and new custom deliveries too.

While the Selfish author wanted to name her third child Mary Jo (after her grandma) or Grace, she and the Grammy winner settled on Chicago, the city that “made him,” even though it was more than a single syllable.  Days after the infant’s arrival, the KKW Beauty creator opened up about her decision to hire a surrogate to carry her.  “I have always been really honest about my struggles with pregnancy.  Preeclampsia and placenta accreta are high-risk conditions, so when I wanted to have a third baby, doctors said that it wasn’t safe for my — or the baby’s — health to carry on my own,” the reality star wrote.  “After exploring many options, Kanye and I decided to use a gestational carrier.  … Since we implanted my fertilized egg in our gestational carrier, our baby is biologically mine and Kanye’s. ” The E! personality hired a different surrogate to welcome her and the rapper’s fourth child, Psalm, whom arrived in May 2019.  Two years after his birth, multiple source confirmed to Us that the pair’s marriage had reached the point of no return amid divorce rumors.  While Kardashian shares many sweet shots of Chicago with her siblings, the little one also loves her cousins.  Kylie Jenner welcomed daughter Stormi with her boyfriend, Travis Scott, in February 2018, followed by Khloé Kardashian’s daughter with Tristan Thompson, True, in April of that same year.

The rules will take effect immediately, according to a statement from the State Administration for Market Regulation, the nation’s antitrust watchdog. The regulations will curb anti-competitive behavior such as sharing sensitive consumer data, forming alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing below cost services to eliminate competitors, the regulator said. Read More: China Clampdown on Big Tech Puts More Billionaires on NoticeChina’s Politburo, the top decision-making body of the Communist Party, vowed in a meeting at the end of last year to strengthen anti-monopoly efforts in 2021.  Less than two weeks after the meeting, China kicked off an investigation into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  for allegedly monopolistic practices. Lawsuits over competition issues have been filed by companies even as regulators are moving to step up scrutiny.  ByteDance Ltd.  filed a lawsuit last week against Tencent Holdings Ltd.  over alleged monopolies in its WeChat and QQ platforms, escalating a feud between two giants of Chinese social media.  A court in Beijing has agreed to hear the case, a ByteDance representative confirmed on Sunday.

(NASDAQ: ATVI) reported fourth-quarter results Thursday that lifted shares to a new 52-week high, while four Street analysts see further upside ahead.  The Activision Blizzard Analysts: Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok maintains an Outperform rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with a price target lifted from $109 to $120.  Needham analyst Laura Martin maintains a Buy rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with an unchanged $102 price target.  Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintains an Overweight rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with a price target from $108 to $115.  KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Tyler Parker maintains an Overweight rating on Activision Blizzard's stock with a price target lifted from $102 to $120.  RayJay Sees Strength In 2021, Beyond: Activision Blizzard's revenue rose 13% year-over-year to $3. 05 billion versus the Street’s estimate of $2. 83 billion, Marok said in a note.  Revenue from the Activision segment rose 16% to $1. 66 billion; King revenue was up 15% at $577 million; and Blizzard’s segment revenue was down 3% at $579 million, the analyst said.  The company’s core franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, all showed “robust” bookings growth in the quarter, he said.  Momentum should be sustained in 2021 and beyond ahead of multiple launches, including a potential remaster release this year and World of Warcraft mobile titles that are in advanced development, according to RayJay.  Needham's 5 Key Takeaways: Activision’s earnings report is highlighted by five key takeaways, Martin said in a note.  They are: 1.  The company noted its games reach 400 million players in 190 countries.  2.  Throughout 2020, the company had three game franchises that generated $1 billion in net bookings.  Management guided toward two additional games hitting the $1-billion revenue milestone.  3.  Activision expects to grow in 2021 despite difficult year-over-year comparisons.  View more earnings on ATVI 4.  Management will focus development efforts on its largest franchises with the objective of duplicating the CoD model of monetizing free-to-play games.  5.  Warzone more than doubled its player base and generated a lot of interest in free premium trials.  Related Link: For Some Video Game ETFs, It Was Fun While It Lasted With GameStop Morgan Stanley's Reopening Concerns: Video games were one of several categories that saw a notable uptick in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers were looking for more forms of entertainment at home.  Now that the reopening phase is very slowly starting to take place in some regions, it was ""encouraging"" to hear Activision's management say they are seeing momentum in reopening regions, Nowak said.  Ongoing demand in areas that are more advanced in the reopening process can be attributed to Activision's content and quality of its products, the analyst said.  Encouragingly, Activision's 2021 EPS outlook of $3. 60 could be conservative, he said.  ""Given ATVI's historically pragmatic approach to forward guidance (having beaten their initial full year EPS guidance by 16% on average from '16-'19) we struggle to believe the company would have guided as aggressively as they did without a margin of safety on re-opening. "" KeyBanc Says 2022 Looks Big': Activision's fourth-quarter report came in better than expected, and the company's outlook through 2022 ""looks big,"" Parker said in a note.  Activision's 2021 bookings guidance was stronger than expected despite the absence of a new AAA game this year, the analyst said.  This suggests ongoing strength in the broader gaming market, but also momentum across Activision's portfolio, he said.  Activision hinted at a ""step-function change"" in 2022 that will be driven by a WoW expansion, a ramp in Diablo Immortal and a potential Overwatch 2 release, Parker said.  ""ATVI's franchise strategy to expand offerings to more platforms and models is working, and we believe there are multiple opportunities in place to grow the business for years to come.

House Democrats voted to boot her from her committee assignments in an act that they will surely come to regret, perhaps as soon as January 2023.  If the majority can keep members of the opposition party off of committees based on incendiary comments, it’s not clear why the GOP ever let, say, Maxine Waters serve on any committees when it had control of the chamber, or why it ever will again.  Kicking off Greene will come to be remembered as another inflection point in the steady unraveling of institutional norms on Capitol Hill.  That said, we believe that Republicans should have taken matters into their own hands and denied Greene her committee assignments to draw a line against malicious lunacy in their own ranks.  That Democrats had a gun to his head with their threat to have a floor vote on Greene’s committee assignments probably made it more politically difficult for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to act on his own.  He did seek a deal with the Democrats to take her off the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Budget Committee and instead relegate her to the Small Business Committee.  When Democrats didn’t bite, McCarthy again condemned her past comments and wrung an expression of regret from her in an internal GOP meeting earlier in the week that she repeated on the House floor on Thursday.  Her statement didn’t ring with sincerity, but it was better than nothing, even if she was immediately holding a combative press conference where she said, “I’m fine with being kicked off committees because it’d be a waste of my time. ” We have, no doubt, not heard the last of her. #https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-regret-move-against-marjorie-113058115.html#RwBEmsorR

It's not clear if Biden will officially cut off Trump's access, but such a move would be unprecedented — traditionally, former presidents can request and receive briefings.  David Priess, who briefed former President George H. W.  Bush for many years after he left office, told The Washington Post that ex-presidents continue to receive intelligence briefings because even though they're no longer in an official position of power, they are considered representatives of the United States, especially by foreign leaders, for the rest of their lives.  He added that presidents also may turn to their predecessors for advice on international affairs.  That said, Priess agrees with Biden that an exception could be made for Trump since ""there's no chance of Biden reaching out to Trump . . .  So why would Biden run the risk of Trump's disclosure of sensitive information by agreeing to such briefings?"" Journalist Yashar Ali did note that former presidents can also interact with other governments privately, as former President Bill Clinton did when he traveled to North Korea in 2009 to secure the release of two journalists being held there.  Clinton, Ali, notes was briefed even though it wasn't an official U. S.  government trip.  2.

Micah Hirokawa, director of Maria Montessori Academy said on the school’s Facebook page on Friday that he “reluctantly” sent out a letter explaining families are allowed “to exercise their civil rights to not participate in Black History Month at the school,” according to NBC News.  Hirokawa said “few families” asked that their children be excluded from instruction related to Black History Month, but he declined to give the exact number of parents or their reasons for making the request. #https://news.yahoo.com/parents-allowed-remove-students-black-215225651.html#iDnIyh3Vs
