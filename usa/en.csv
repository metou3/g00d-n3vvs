In fact, the only two inaugurations to draw more viewers were Ronald Reagan's first inaugural in 1981, watched by 41. 8 million viewers, and Barack Obama's 2009 swearing-in, with 37. 8 million people watching.  Biden's 33. 8 million viewers easily topped Trump's 30. 6 million, Nielsen said.  More people watched Trump's inauguration on Fox News, though.  The network saw a 77 percent decline in viewers for Biden's ceremony versus Trump's.  CNN more than made up for the difference — its inaugural coverage was the No.  8 show in all of prime time last week, Nielsen said.  In the cable wars, CNN came in first last week, followed by MSNBC and then Fox News.  Trump, if he were bothered about getting lower ratings than Biden, might take a little bit of solace in the fact that more people attended his inauguration in person four years ago.

And then some? Wall Street analysts did.  A consensus sees Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) as joining that rarefied corporate crowd that’s broken the $100 billion in quarterly revenues mark when it opens the books Wednesday on its fiscal Q1.  That’s a record for AAPL, of course, and may have been assisted by holiday sales of its new iPhone 12.  But it’s one in a series of fresh peaks AAPL has scored in a year—one the company acknowledged was rocked by adversity in many corners.  Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the strong results in last quarter’s report were driven by “the unmatched loyalty of our customers. ” That may or not be true, but when AAPL reports earnings, investors also will be listening to how well AAPL is playing the market share game.  The work-from-home trend, fueled by the pandemic, looks like it might have been a game-changer for AAPL, according to Morningstar analysts who believe it powered sales of iPads, desktops, and laptops.  All that could be overshadowed in fiscal Q1 by iPhone 12 holiday sales, which it’s probably safe to say will get a fair share of attention Wednesday afternoon following the closing bell.  AAPL has always been an attention-getter when earnings season rolls around, and now, with it sporting a $2. 34 trillion market cap and reaching new stock price highs, it looks like it’s sure to take a spot under the limelight even when it’s up against a host of other high-profile tech stocks earnings results this week.  Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Facebook, Inc.  (NASDAQ: FB) report the same afternoon.  The Numbers Wall Street analysts expect AAPL revenue to jump 12% year-over-year to about $103 billion, according to FactSet.  But some firms, such as Loup Ventures, are looking for much stronger numbers: up 19% to $109. 5 billion.  From an earnings perspective, the Street has reached a consensus of $1. 41 a share.  Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is also forecasting on the high side of consensus, eyeing revenues of $108. 2 billion and earnings per share of $1. 50.  “Our recent conversations suggest investors expect Apple to release solid, but not great, December quarter results,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent report.  “We disagree and believe that Apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings.  “In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple’s most successful product launch in the last five years,” they said.  More on that later.  Any way you look at it, the numbers look robust.  The Innovation Machine AAPL stopped giving guidance last year—kind of like many other companies uncertain of the ramifications of COVID-19 on their sales.  In March, no one knew what the ricochet effects of the pandemic might be or how long it might last.  We still don’t know all of that, but we have found that the city- and state-mandated quarantines and the overall fear of being in public helped fast-forward many trends that were already picking up steam.  The digital transformation sped up, and it looks like AAPL might have been well-positioned for it.  While the iPhone 12 might get most of the attention Wednesday, think back to last quarter when CEO Tim Cook noted all-time records for Mac and Services.  Though he didn’t offer guidance for this past quarter per se, he did suggest double-digit gains on all product categories except the iPhone 12, which he thought would reach single-digit gains.  FIGURE 1: APPLE LEAVES INDEX IN THE DUST.  Over the last year, shares of Apple (AAPL—candlestick) have easily outpaced the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX—purple line).  Apple shares got off to a quick start in 2021, with investors apparently enthusiastic about tomorrow’s Q1 earnings prospects.  Data source: Nasdaq.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade.  For illustrative purposes only.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  The Mighty iPhone 5G Launch Despite all the happy talk about fiscal Q4 revenues, iPhone’s weaker-than-expected sales offset the glee and pulled shares down nearly 6% in the first couple of days after the October earnings release.  They have since recovered.  AAPL reported iPhone sales of $26. 4 billion in fiscal Q4, below the $27. 73 billion expected by the Street.  Much of that shortfall was attributed to AAPL’s decision to push the iPhone 12 launch into this most recent quarter, a move many believe may have led to consumers waiting for the upgrade before they bought.  Back then, some analysts said a move to 5G could end up being a tailwind for the iPhone 12 with sales promotions and subscription services bundles.  That, combined with the important holiday shopping season about to begin, could have led to a fast start for the new phone.  We’ll see now if they were right.  Analysts are mostly bullish on their iPhone sales expectations, with some saying the delay might have pushed around $4 billion in iPhone sales to the December quarter from the fiscal Q3.  The Street’s consensus last stood at $59. 58 billion, up better than 6% on a year-over-year basis.  But Loup Ventures thinks that’s conservative.  It’s looking for sales to vault 16% on a year-over-year basis to $64. 9 billion, jumping to 59% of total sales compared with the iPhone’s typical 50% of sales standing.  It’s unclear if that will actually be the case, but if it is it would reverse a trend in recent years toward iPhones being less of AAPL’s total revenue.  The company has been emphasizing growth in services.  Remember, we’re just two years out from January 2019 when Cook sent a letter to AAPL investors warning of a fiscal Q1 earnings shortfall due in part to weak iPhone sales in China.  How things have changed.  AAPL Earnings And Options Activity AAPL is expected to report an adjusted EPS of $1. 41, up from $1. 25 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates.  Revenue is projected at $103. 01 billion, up 16. 4% from a year ago.  The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 6. 2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.  Looking at the Jan.  29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 125 and 135 strikes.  But it’s been dwarfed by activity to the upside, heavy call volume at the 145 and 150 strikes.  The implied volatility sits at the 34th percentile as of Tuesday morning.  Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Home Work And Its Tools The work- and study-from-home phenomenon helped drive sales of Macs and iPads last year, and analysts widely expect that trend continued into the fiscal Q1.  A number of bells and whistles were added to new iPads and iPad Airs, and new computers with AAPL’s custom M1 chip replacing the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) chip also hit the market.  AAPL also is reportedly working on a new iPad Pro expected to be released in mid-March.  There’s also talk on Wall Street that AAPL might have patented a new version of the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro.  Given Cook’s comments about the “most prolific product introduction period,” analysts widely expect to hear about other new products coming on line.  An update of the MacBook Air is one of those possible developments.  AAPL is working on a thinner and lighter version of the MacBook Air, Bloomberg reported late last week, citing “people with knowledge of the matter.  Analysts said they want to know if the planned release in the second half of this year is on track.  Analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.  expect AAPL to shed light on several new products and services, including how sales are going for its $549 AirPods Max over-the-ear headphones and the subscription Apple Fitness+ offering, plus ways to bundle services together for a discount.  “In our view, Apple’s portfolio was positioned better-than-ever heading into the recent holiday season, while product and service updates position Planet Apple well in 2021,” the team wrote.  And So Much More Among the myriad reasons AAPL’s earnings are such a magnet goes beyond products Other factors underscoring the company’s progress range from privacy concerns to app developer fees to government interventions and the overall economy.  AAPL has done much to address many of these issues, but each quarter tends to introduce a fresh crop.  In November, for example, AAPL said it would cut in half the commissions it charges smaller developers who sell software through the App Store and generate under $1 million in sales.  AAPL’s original 30% take has long fueled complaints from developers, users and governments over its dominance in the digital world.  The price cut to 15% appeased some but not all stakeholders and analysts hope the company will address how the cuts are panning out in the beginning weeks.  Another question heading into earnings is AAPL’s cash position.  The total cash trove stood at roughly $192 billion at the end of the company’s fiscal Q4, with about $112 billion in debt and a little more than $79 billion in cash.  AAPL returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.  Investors can expect to continue to see more of that ahead, according to Loup Ventures, which estimates an additional $73 billion will be returned in coming years.

2021-01-26 17:08:03#tech#Now you can play The Elder Scrolls in an Elder Scrolls chair, wearing your Elder Scrolls ring#https://www.pcgamer.com/now-you-can-play-the-elder-scrolls-in-an-elder-scrolls-chair-wearing-your-elder-scrolls-ring/#https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R23joDnAoYiMSi8jPbFLGX-1200-80.png#en#0.34#www.pcgamer.com#"The Elder Scrolls games take place in the world of Tamriel, and key to this universe is chairs.  Just you try caning Skyrim from a standing position.  In a rather obvious brand tie-up, there is now an Elder Scrolls Online-themed chair coming from Noblechairs, a company whose sedentary solutions apparently ""combine the latest ergonomics and sports-inspired design. ""(To be fair, it does look a bit sportier than this unfortunate customer.  We're still waiting to find out the reason behind the Twitch ban. )What is there to say about a chair? Perhaps now is the time to invoke the theory of forms, Plato's notion that, even if all the chairs in the world were to be destroyed, there would still remain an inviolable, timeless idea of the chair in the human mind.  All objects are mere imitations of this ideal chair.  Who is to say that this The Elder Scrolls Online is not very close to that essence, that soul of a chair?The chair is based on Noblechairs' existing HERO model, which we reckon is the best gaming chair around for back support.  This design is ""now merged with premium grade black and gold PU leather, gold stitching and high-detail embroidered artwork"" (PU or polyurethane leather is an artificial leather). You can sign up here to be notified when the chair is available.  No price is listed, but the chair type is the modestly-named HERO which usually clocks in at around $500 (as it did for an old Fallout tie-in).  Next to an Elder Scrolls wedding ring that costs a cool grand, this looks like a snip.

The new computer is planned to be released during the second half of this year at the earliest or in 2022.  It will include Apple’s MagSafe charging technology and a next-generation version of the company’s in-house Mac processors.  Apple has discussed making the laptop smaller by shrinking the border around the screen, which will remain 13-inches.  The current model weighs 2. 8 pounds and is just over half an inch at its thickest point.  The company considered building a larger version of the MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen, but Apple isn’t moving forward with this for the next generation, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. MagSafe, which was removed from the MacBook Air with its 2018 redesign, is a magnetic charging system.  That means any accidental yanking of the power cable would simply detach it from the laptop rather than pull down the entire computer.  The new model will have a pair of USB 4 ports for connecting external devices.  The new laptop is destined to be a higher-end version of the current MacBook Air, which is expected to remain in the company’s lineup as an entry-level offering.  Apple last updated the product in November with its own M1 Mac chip, replacing a processor from Intel Corp.  The Mac is Apple’s oldest product line and has a loyal following.  A few years ago, the company was criticized for not updating these computers enough and not paying attention to customer demands.  Now, there’s a flood of updates coming.  In addition to the new MacBook Air, Apple is planning its biggest update to the MacBook Pro since 2016, the first redesign of the iMac in nearly a decade, a new Intel-based Mac Pro, and a half-sized Mac Pro desktop with in-house chips. The upcoming MacBook Pro is an example of Apple’s renewed focus on Mac loyalists.  The company is planning to bring back an SD card slot for the next MacBook Pros so users can insert memory cards from digital cameras.  That feature was removed in 2016, to the consternation of professional photographers and video creators, key segments of the MacBook Pro user base.  The heavily criticized Touch Bar, the current model’s touchscreen function row, is also going.  Apple has also developed underlying Mac support for both cellular connectivity — the ability for Macs to connect to the internet via smartphone networks — and Face ID, the company’s facial recognition system.  But neither feature appears to be coming soon.  To that end, Face ID had originally been planned to arrive in this year’s iMac redesign, but it’s now unlikely to be included in the first iteration of the new design.

2021-01-26 14:05:54#business#Tesla, BMW Approved for Slice of $3.5 Billion EU Battery Aid#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-bmw-approved-slice-3-134013171.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F_o7xdbFbCeYM1V1SsTreQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/96b09f9a622d3139018f9022cf360dd0#en#0.4215#finance.yahoo.com#(Bloomberg) -- The European Union paved the way for companies including Tesla Inc.  and BMW AG to get about 2. 9 billion euros ($3. 5 billion) of state aid for battery projects that will strengthen the bloc’s position in the race to produce more electric vehicles. The European Commission expects the support to trigger more than three times as much private investment, bringing the total spent to about 12 billion euros.  The aid will go to 42 companies across a dozen countries, with beneficiaries also including Fiat Chrysler owner Stellantis NV and startup Northvolt AB. The 27-nation bloc plans to slash greenhouse gas emissions from transport under the European Green Deal, an ambitious economic overhaul aimed at reaching climate neutrality by 2050.  Along the way, the EU wants to reduce its reliance on EV batteries from Asian producers.  The value of Europe’s battery market will reach 250 billion euros by 2025 and meet demands from the auto industry, according to the commission. “Europe will cement in this way its position as a global hot spot for battery investment,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said.  “This pan-European project will help revolutionize the battery market. ”More information about the amount of aid going to each project will be available in the public version of the Commission’s decision once it has agreed with member states and third parties on any confidential business secrets that need to be removed. Aid for the projects, which are expected to be completed by 2028, will be disbursed by countries including Finland, Spain, France and Poland, and was coordinated by Germany.  It follows a 3. 2 billion-euro package to support a total of 9 billion euros of public and private spending that was coordinated by France and approved in December 2019. Pouring InBattery investment has poured in as Europe’s stricter pollution standards forces carmakers to embrace electric cars and limit carbon-dioxide emissions.  BloombergNEF is forecasting 1. 9 million sales of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles in Europe this year, topping China and almost quadrupling the total expected in North America. As part of the Green Deal, the EU wants to toughen its 2030 emissions-reduction target to at least 55% from 1990 levels, compared with the existing goal of a 40% cut.  The overhaul is a key pillar of the region’s strategy to recover from the virus-induced recession. European policy makers are aware the bloc’s key industries risk falling behind if they don’t fill manufacturing gaps in energy-storage technology.  Lithium-ion batteries will power plug-in cars and also help balance electric grids transmitting renewable energy including wind and solar. The battery initiative announced Tuesday got priority status as an Important Project of Common European Interest, or IPCEI.  It will involve research and development of new technologies to reduce or completely eliminate cobalt or natural graphite and replace it with synthetics. The projects will cover the entire battery value chain, from extraction of raw materials, design and manufacturing of battery cells and packs, and recycling and disposal.  The aid is expected to contribute to development of technological breakthroughs, including different cell chemistries, novel production processes and other innovations. Tesla’s AmbitionsTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the electric-car maker plans to add a battery-cell production facility at the vehicle-assembly plant it’s building near Berlin.  The site will initially have capacity of more than 100 gigawatt-hours a year and eventually ramp up to as much as 250 gigawatt-hours, Musk said during a battery conference in November. “I’m pretty confident at that point it would be the largest battery-cell plant in the world,” Musk said.  He didn’t give time frames for when he expects the facility to reach those capacity levels. The factory Tesla is building in the small town of Gruenheide will be the company’s first in Europe.  It’s slated to start making vehicle in the middle of this year and eventually assemble as many as 500,000 cars annually.  While construction is far along, the company is still awaiting final approval for the project from local authorities.  It also has been hung up by environmental groups’ legal challenges. Other carmakers investing in European battery production include PSA Group, which merged with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis.  It set up a joint venture called Automotive Cells Company with French oil giant Total SA’s Saft unit in September.  Sweden’s Northvolt will operate a plant with Volkswagen AG in Germany, with BMW also participating in the project and ordering billions’ worth of batteries from the startup. Asian battery giants including South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. , Japan’s Panasonic Corp.  and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.  Ltd.  also have said they’re going to set up or expand operations in the region.

What Happened: The hedge fund manager aired his displeasure at the short squeeze on Twitter.  If I put $GME on your radar, and you did well, I’m genuinely happy for you.  However, what is going on now – there should be legal and regulatory repercussions.  This is unnatural, insane, and dangerous.  @SEC_Enforcement — Cassandra (@michaeljburry) January 27, 2021 Burry also tagged the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement arm in his Twitter post.  The physician-investor is known for “The Big Short,” a film in which he was played by Christian Bale.  The movie is based on his bet against the US housing market.  Why It Matters: Burry owned 1. 7 million GameStop shares worth $17 million at the end of September, reported Business Insider.  The shares would be now worth $250 million, which is a 1,400% increase, as of Tuesday’s close.  GameStop shares surged over 41. 5% in the after-hours session after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted “Gamestonk!!” on Tuesday.  Musk also included a link to the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets that has pushed the retailer’s shares higher and put pressure on short sellers.  See Also: GameStop's Power Surge: Will WallStreetBets Or The Short Sellers Come Out On Top?

Both vaccines produced lower levels of coronavirus antibodies than have been found in the blood of individuals who recovered from natural COVID-19 infections.  For reference, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines produced antibody levels several times higher than natural infections. The unsuccessful trials are disappointing in large part because both Merck vaccines would have required just one dose, writes Stat.  One of the candidates, which uses the same virus as the one in Merck's successful Ebola vaccine, was being developed in partnership with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which has said it will try to determine if using an oral or intranasal administration route will work better than the current intramuscular injection.  It's unclear if Merck will continue to collaborate — IAVI's president Mark Feinberg told Stat he hopes they do — because the pharmaceutical company has suggested it will now turn its focus to developing COVID-19 therapeutics. As Stat notes, the results show just how difficult vaccine development can be, especially in such a short amount of time, making the rapid success of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots seem all the more remarkable.

The company's burger patties and sausages have been among the leaders in the surge in interest in plant-based alternatives over the past two years as consumers worried about their health, animal welfare and food safety.  The new partnership will give the plant-based meat maker access to the beverage giant's distribution and marketing resources and allow it to expand into new product lines, Beyond Meat Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said. #https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-beyond-meat-partner-develop-133608887.html#cHUyBVwkU

The stock climbed as much as 32% at the open on Tuesday, putting its market capitalization at about $7 billion and making GameStop worth more than the likes of Perrigo Co. , Apache Corp. , Leggett & Platt Inc. , and Hanesbrands Inc.  It surpassed insurance-provider Unum Group, HollyFrontier Corp. , and Flowserve Corp.  on Monday. The video-game retailer has climbed about 400% this year with traders piling into the stock after activist investor and Chewy Inc.  co-founder Ryan Cohen joined its board earlier this month.  Options trading has also surged with retail investors ramping up bets on even more upside. The stock’s surge has in part been fueled by an army of Reddit-charged day traders who used the website’s WallStreetBets forum to pump up shares and fight back against the eye-popping levels of short interest.  Bets by Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital and Andrew Left’s Citron Research have faced a reckoning in the battle with GameStop’s retail fans. Hedge fund titans Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen boosted Melvin Capital, according to a statement on Monday, injecting a total of $2. 75 billion into the firm after it lost about 30% this year.  The capital infusion came after Melvin Capital, which started the year with about $12. 5 billion in assets, saw short bets, including GameStop, go awry, people familiar with the firm said.

The IRS has delayed the start of the filing season until Feb.  12.  Normally, the agency starts accepting tax returns in late January.  Why the delay? The IRS says it needs more time to reprogram its computers based on the COVID Relief Act which wasn’t signed into law until the end of December. #https://komonews.com/news/consumer/irs-delays-start-of-tax-filing-season#aLdKyEGav

For all the transformation still undergoing Fortnite, 2017 feels like too small a distance for a game to have gone from rumored vaporware to global phenomenon.  I scored the earliest version of Fortnite a 55 at the time, a clearly troubled project that Epic Games just needed to get out after spinning its wheels in development purgatory.  Fortnite would either take on new life in the hands of players or fizzle out and die of natural causes.  It happens.  But just as the battle royale craze spun up in the wake of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' surprise success, Epic pulled an historic U-turn and put out Fortnite: Battle Royale, then a simple spin-off developed in three months.  Over time Fortnite's improvisational development helped establish a modern vocabulary for live games with in-game events, battle passes, and consistent seasonal cycles.  Fortnite saw the rise of Ninja and mainstream Twitch celebrity at large, it saw Epic try out bonkers marketing stunts like the complete shutdown of Fortnite for a few days just to generate awareness and usher in Chapter 2.  Fortnite became such a cultural, money-printing force that Epic went as far as to abandon the iOS platform as a form of protest over ""monopolistic practices,"" even accompanying the move with a parody of Apple's own 1984-inspired Macintosh ad.  And now, in 2021, Fortnite is still trucking along, still making stuff up on the fly, but it's settled into a more comfortable rhythm.  Fortnite is a battle royale toy box without a bottom, and with every recognizable character and brand waiting for their turn in the item shop.  Even if you've played before, look away for a second and Fortnite will take on a totally new look when you turn back.  So let's take a look at the state of Fortnite in 2021 and try to guess how this megagame might transform further. "#https://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-fortnite-in-2021/#SDAkTnn1r

The Schitt's Creek star shared her plans to sell the dress to the highest bidder on Jan.  21, and noted that 100 percent of proceeds will go to charity.  ""This was the very first thing I wore on my very first red carpet (the Canadian Screen Awards in 2015) so yeah, there might be anxiety sweat in the armpits, but there are pockets in the dress, so it balances out,"" she captioned an Instagram post.  ""I would very much like to sell it to you if you're in the market. "" The proceeds from the dress will be evenly split between two charities, including Encampment Support Network, a volunteer-run network that helps individuals living in tent encampments across Toronto.  Murphy will enlist the help of her followers to choose the second charity (Canadian or American) to support.  As a seasoned trend setter, Murphy knows that we shop with our eyes, but she threw in a few key details about the dress to make it even more appealing to potential bidders.  Highlights of the elegant gown include: ""It's black. "" ""It has pockets. "" ""It's made by evening wear brand Wayne Clark Designs. "" ""It is sweaty in and around the armpit area. "" ""It's a size 4. "" ""There's a big ol 'v' in the front so your skin can pop out of there. "" ""It's very nice. "" Interested in expanding your wardrobe to reflect a little more of the true style icon behind Alexis Rose? Anyone willing to donate a sizeable amount to charity can email Murphy at csadress69@gmail. com.  She'll only respond to the highest bidders, so this might be the time to gather up the gang and have everyone chip in on the most squeal-worthy of dresses, as Alexis might say.  Take a closer look at Murphy's evening gown from the 2015 Canadian Screen Awards here.

The Inquisitor stabs a knife directly into a map of the Tevinter Imperium at the end of the Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC Trespasser, for one thing, and BioWare pointed a finger in the same direction in 2020 with the release of a collection of short stories called Tevinter Nights. The writing's been on the wall.  But now, it's in an actual licensed book.  Any doubts about the location of the new game have been dispelled by the recently released BioWare: Stories and Secrets from 25 Years of Game Development, a book celebrating the studio's 25th anniversary with art, pictures, commentary, and stories.  Tom Phillips of Eurogamer scored himself a copy, and found an official confirmation inside. ""As BioWare entered its twenty-fifth year, the Dragon Age team was hard at work on Morrison, the code name of the long-awaited follow-up to Dragon Age: Inquisition,"" an entry on page 324 called ""Tevinter Bound: A sneak peek at the follow-up to Inquisition"" states. ""The game, helmed by executive producer Mark Darrah, will take players to Tevinter as the events of Inquisition and Trespasser threaten to forever change Thedas.

They’re paying up for bullish derivatives tracking the Chinese internet firm, buying thousands of January call options that expire Thursday.  The price of one Tencent contract -- which bets the stock will rise past HK$800 by expiry -- surged as much as 118,300% on Monday.  Traders also rushed to offload their bearish puts, with one of the most-traded contracts losing more than 84% in value. The stock rallied 11% on Monday to HK$766. 50, its biggest gain since October 2011.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index benchmark rose 2. 4%, closing above the key 30,000 point-level for the first time since May 2019. Tencent has become a prime target for mainland traders flooding record amounts of cash into Hong Kong-listed shares this year, with net purchase of the stock accounting for roughly a quarter of total money coming in, according to exchange data.  The buying frenzy has also boosted Tencent’s market value by about $251 billion this year, the most worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tesla Inc.  is the second-largest gainer, up $134 billion. Tencent shares now trade at nearly 40 times analysts’ estimated earnings for the next 12 months.  While that’s well above the average of 30 since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2005, it’s still below the recent peak multiple of 42 reached in 2014 and 2018.  It reached 65 at the height of China’s equity bubble in 2007. On Monday, analysts at Citigroup Inc.  lifted their target price on the firm by 19% to HK$876, the highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, citing the company’s market-share expansion and growth in the gaming sector and other digital businesses. Tencent is also getting an additional boost from taking part in the city’s fast-growing initial public offering market.  Kuaishou Technology, backed by Tencent, is seeking to raise as much as $5. 4 billion in Hong Kong in what would be the biggest internet IPO since Uber Technologies Inc. With the recent run-up, Tencent is trading at its highest price on record.  It’s largely avoided the tightening regulatory oversight that sparked a selloff in rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and forced its part-owned Ant Group Co.  to jettison a record IPO.

The secret? Run forward and shoot your gun. Speedrunner Wreak finished the level in 9 seconds on January 22nd, followed by Der_Lauch_Linus on the 23rd.  The speedy completion is due to the level's funky architecture.  The Dubai level takes place on the top floors of a skyscraper, and in the moments after the start of the level both targets are visible on balconies above Agent 47's starting point.  So you move quick, aim well, and shoot them both in seconds.  You can watch Wreak's record run here and Der_Lauch_Linus' record here.  Bonus points to Wreak for wearing a sillier costume than Linus.

They added that one of the issues discussed was Iran.  * In recent days, Sullivan made calls to his counterparts in the U.

The big picture: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned about President Biden's stated goal of trying to resume the nuclear deal with Iran.

While Taiwan has kept the pandemic well under control thanks to early and effective prevention, with the large majority of its 890 infections imported cases, it has since Jan.  12 been dealing with a small number of domestic transmissions at a hospital.  Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters that they will expand the number of people who have to quarantine at home for 14 days who may have had contact with the infected patients from the hospital cluster. #https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-put-5-000-quarantine-130047308.html#hiYiiYnM8

Social media is awash with people seeking or giving tips on how to maneuver the system.  State officials are frustrated the federal government hasn't provided more doses.  Local officials are upset Gov.  Gavin Newsom last week suddenly added the 4 million residents between ages 65 and 74 to what was supposed to be a shorter list of people first in line for shots, including health care workers and those in nursing care facilities.  Adding to the confusion is a hodgepodge of systems and differing requirements in the state's 58 counties.  For example, Los Angeles and Orange counties authorized mass vaccination sites like Dodger Stadium and Disneyland to give shots to those over 65, while San Francisco is relying largely on hospital systems to vaccinate only patients 75 and up.  Some counties are vaccinating first responders, grocery clerks and farm workers, while others are finishing up health care workers before moving to other groups.  The variety of approaches invariably means, for example, envious seniors in one part of the state are left wondering when it’s their turn as they see video of others getting shots.  Those include 73-year-old former Gov.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, who touted his inoculation at Dodger Stadium this week with a famous line from his Terminator films: “Come with me if you want to live. ” Another senior citizen, Oakland resident Sam Burd, had a frustrating week trying to get shots for himself and his wife.  He had noticed long lines snaking outside the nonprofit Asian Health Services and ran into a neighbor on Wednesday who said she had received vaccine there.  He asked for the. . . #https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Hodgepodge-systems-confusion-mar-California-15892717.php#noMhsia6Z

China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, the developer's Hong Kong-listed unit, is raising HK$26 billion (US$3. 35 billion) selling 952. 4 million new shares at HK$27. 30 each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday.  The price represents a 9 per cent discount to the last traded level on Friday, and the stake amounts to about 9. 75 per cent of its enlarged capital. Some of the richest Hong Kong and mainland tycoons have agreed to subscribe for the shares, the company said.  They include Chan Hoi-wan of developer Chinese Estate Holdings and spouse of Joseph Lau Luen-hung, as well as Liu Ming-hui, the founder of China Gas Holdings.  Each will buy HK$3 billion of stake.  The buyers have agreed to a 12-month lock-up on their shares. Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China. The stock placement shows the investors' confidence in the business prospects and can also strengthen its capital base, according to the company's filing.  It will help the Group's strategic goal of becoming ""the world's largest and most powerful new energy vehicle group,"" it added. Chinese EV makers like NIO, Xpeng, and Li Auto are rushing to catch an expected upswing in demand as China's economic rebound gains traction after growth quickened to a pre-pandemic pace of more than 6 per cent last quarter.  China is also set to become the world's biggest market for EV when 4 million cars, or one in every five vehicles, will be powered by electricity by 2025. The race to the market is preceded by a rush to build a war chest of capital.  China Evergrande NEV earlier sold 176. 6 million of new shares in September for about HK$4 billion, or HK$22. 65 each.  Earlier this month, NIO raised about US$1. 3 billion from the sale of convertible bonds, while Xpeng got US$1. 98 billion of credit lines from five mainland banking groups.  Last week, BYD announced a stock placement to raise US$3. 9 billon. China Evergrande NEV is controlled by the country's third richest tycoon Hui Ka-yan.  His plan is to raise its car production capacity to 500,000 to 1 million vehicles within three to five years, the company said on its website.  Its plants in Shanghai and Guangzhou will be capable of rolling out 200,000 units a year each at the beginning, before reaching 1 million by the fifth year, it added. The company's shares have risen 307 per cent over the past 12 months, giving it a market value of about US$34 billion despite incurring huge losses over the past two years.  The other four investors who have agreed to take up HK$5 billion each in the stock placement include businessmen from its home base Shenzhen. China Evergrande NEV intends to spend the money on technology research and development, production of new energy vehicle business and repay older debt, it said in the filing.

Dining in a restaurant might involve a tent and heat lamps, doctors appointments are conducted via telemedicine apps, and gone are the days of meandering your way through a mall.  Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has one more addition to the growing list of lifestyle changes: Staring Tuesday, you'll be required to provide evidence of a negative COVID test before flying back to the U. S.  from any international destination. ""If you plan to travel internationally, you will need to get tested no more than 3 days before you travel by air into the United States (US) and show your negative result to the airline before you board your flight, or be prepared to show documentation of recovery,"" reads the new policy, which was posted to the CDC's website on Jan.  23. As the new policy mandates, airlines must refuse to board anyone who fails to provide a negative COVID test result.  This could very well disrupt travel plans for some, but should help to minimize potential exposure for those flying, as well as the broader public. According to David Cutler, MD, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, the CDC's new policy has arrived not a moment too soon.  As he explains, the ""recently increased ability of COVID to pass from person to person is making air travel and all activities more risky for contracting this disease. ""Longer flights already pose a risk that experts say is incalculable at this time.  Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), said in a recent interview that shorter flights may be safe due to HEPA filter use for ""modest duration flights,"" but for long, international flights, ""all bets are off. ""It is impossible to say how safe airline travel might be,"" agrees Cutler.  ""It is important to recognize that anyone around you could transmit COVID to you.  And you could pass it on to others. ""If you must fly, read on for some expert-approved tips on how to do it as safely as possible.  And for the masks you shouldn't wear while flying or in any other situation, check out The CDC Warns Against Using These 6 Face Masks.  1 Skip the flight if you have symptoms.  Just because you get a negative test doesn't necessarily mean you're in the clear.  If you present with any of the typical COVID symptoms, you should seriously consider postponing your flight—even if your test has not confirmed your case. According to the MD Anderson Center at the University of Texas, rapid antigen tests are less accurate than PCR tests at spotting the virus.  And while the CDC doesn't require any particular test type, the three-day window will mean most travelers will use rapid tests, which can deliver results in as little as a half an hour, rather than the two to five days that it takes to get PCR test results. ""To a certain degree, you're sacrificing accuracy with speed.  By their very nature, the antigen style tests aren't as sensitive because they require a larger amount of virus present to be positive,"" explains the MD Anderson website.  ""Someone with a positive test by this style of test should be treated as infected with COVID-19, but a negative test is less reliable and may need to be confirmed. "" And for more regular COVID updates, sign up for our daily newsletter.  2 Be vigilant before you board.  According to Cutler, the risk of flying isn't limited to your flight time.  ""The risk of air travel also includes the risks of transport to the airport,"" along with the time spent navigating airport lines and crowds, he says. ""It is impossible to measure the risk you may be exposed to in these crowded, uncontrolled environments.  That is why travel causes transmission of COVID and why one of the first steps in controlling the pandemic was limiting travel in those countries which effectively reduced the number of cases and deaths,"" Cutler explains.  And for more on how COVID is spreading, see why You're More Likely to Get COVID From Someone Doing This Than From Coughing.  3 Take precautions while using the airport bathroom.  Cutler also suggests exercising additional caution if you need to use the restroom while in the airport or aboard your flight.  These are high-traffic areas that often have questionable ventilation, and while most airports have stepped up their cleaning regimens amid the pandemic, bathrooms can still pose a heightened threat to travelers. If you do use the bathroom facilities, be sure to wear your mask, limit what you touch by using clean paper towels to operate faucets and doors, and wash and sanitize your hands thoroughly afterward.  And for one thing you don't have to do anymore, check out The One Thing You Can Stop Doing to Avoid COVID, CDC Says.  4 Wear a medical grade mask and face shield.  While on board your flight, Cutler explains that your main concern should be mitigating risk from those seated nearest to you.  ""The ventilation systems on commercial airliners contain HEPA air filters which effectively remove nearly any viral particles,"" Cutler explains.  ""Several small studies have confirmed that the majority of the risk while flying comes from the people immediately around you. ""Luckily, you can slash that risk by coming prepared with the right gear, and by optimizing ventilation.  ""That risk can be minimized by wearing an N95 mask and face shield.  You should also turn your overhead air blower on high to push as much clean air at you as possible,"" Cutler advises.  And for more on mask safety, know that If You're Still Doing This, Your Mask Isn't Protecting You, Study Says.

The 1. 3 update will release on February 3rd, and is split into four events: All That Glitters, Lantern Rite Tales, Theater Mechanicus, and the Xiao Market.  Theater Mechanicus is a tower defense battle where players use a gridded arena to place down towers, then fight alongside them against enemy waves.  The new character Xiao, a 5-star, is at the center of much of the update trailer and will receive a story quest to go with him.  Players will get a raftload of free materials in the update, like rate-up wishes and a mini-event that gives out a free 4-star character from the Liyue crew: Xiangling, Xinyan, Beidou, Ningguang, Xingqu, and Chongyun.  There's also an event coming based on the in-game photo mode, with rewards for well-composed shots.  The other mini-events are a mode based around Geovishap mini-bosses and a Geovishap world boss, and a Ley Line update that gives double loot for the first three Ley Lines each day. Additionally, starting now and lasting until the end of January, an online slime festival game lets you get some bonuses in Genshin proper by making slimes happy.  It's adorable—you can find those details here. We considered Genshin Impact, a free-to-play open world RPG out of China, to be one of 2020's biggest and most pleasant gaming surprises.  The new update will also include some fixes for the resin problem.  You can watch the full English livestream of the update reveal below. #https://www.pcgamer.com/genshin-impact-13-comes-in-february-but-an-adorable-slime-festival-is-out-now/#ToGuSi8MZ

SpaceX's rocket has a relatively high payload capacity compared to the size of many of the small satellites produced today, so a rideshare mission like this offers smaller companies and startups a chance to get their spacecraft in orbit without breaking the bank.  The cargo capsule atop the Falcon 9 flying today holds a total of 133 satellites according to SpaceX, which is a new record for the highest number of satellites being launched on a single rocket – beating out a payload of 104 spacecraft delivered by Indian Space Research Organization's PSLV-C37 launch back in February 2017. #https://finance.yahoo.com/news/watch-spacex-launch-first-dedicated-141102174.html#faMkQXiaj

I'm leaning towards excitement with Resident Evil Village, but familiar concerns are spinning back up.  The series is once again following the trajectory of Resident Evil through Resident Evil 3, where sparse combat scenarios featuring one or two slowly shuffling enemies are replaced with legions of zombies sprinting against machine gun fire.  We're going to need some huge fucking guns to take out Village's big hammer oaf. Are we, once again, set to lose the essence of Resident Evil? Not at all: The essence of Resident Evil is that change.  This is a series defined and elevated by major departures from what came before, including the many, many failures, and that's worth celebrating no matter the outcome.  Resident Evil, warts and all, is a damn wonder. #https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/resident-evil-is-a-creative-miracle/#zoZafsX8j

Between the lines: The freeze went into effect Friday, temporarily halting most immigration enforcement in the U. S.  In the lawsuit, Paxton claims the move ""violates the U. S.  Constitution, federal immigration and administrative law, and a contractual agreement between Texas"" and the Department of Homeland Security.  Be smart: sign up FREE for the most influential newsletter in America.  * Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney, told Axios that the lawsuit is likely to fail at fully reinstating deportations because a judge cannot force Immigration and Customs Enforcement to remove any particular person.  * The executive branch has broad authority over immigration enforcement, as was seen in both President Obama and President Trump's administrations.  What they're saying: In the announcement of the moratorium on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said the pause on deportations would ""allow DHS to ensure that its resources are dedicated to responding to the most pressing challenges that the United States faces. "" * In Paxton's request for a temporary restraining order, he claims, ""Without emergency relief, Texas faces irreparable harm from having to provide costly educational, social, welfare, healthcare, and other services to illegal aliens who remain in Texas because Defendants have ceased removing them.

That's a long time to wait for a sequel to such a well-received game, but that wait is almost over: 505 Games announced today that Puzzle Quest 3 is in development and expected to be out later this year. Puzzle Quest 3 will tell an all-new RPG-infused tale in the land of Etheria, set 500 years after the original game, with its match-3 battle system upgraded with ""new and imaginative gameplay mechanics. "" It will be the first game in the series to be published by 505 Games, which recently acquired developer Infinity Plus Two—previously known as Infinite Interactive, the studio behind the first two games in the series—and will be free to play, also a first for the series. ""After an overwhelming demand from fans over the past decade for the next instalment of Puzzle Quest, we're thrilled to finally reveal the development of Puzzle Quest 3,"" Infinity Plus Two CEO Steve Fawkner said.  ""The vision for this latest project has been years in the making, and like any good Puzzle Quest game, it's a delicate balance of gameplay, story, and strategic puzzle-solving while introducing something unexpected that will appeal to both old and new fans. ""That's a lot to put on the shoulders of a match-3 game, but Puzzle Quest is really good (and still eminently playable, if you're curious) and so I'm glad that a new one is finally on the way.  A date hasn't been set yet but 505 said it will be out later this year, and in the meantime you can keep track of what's happening at puzzlequest3. com.

This year will serve as a “transition” after the collapse in travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic, United said as it reported fourth-quarter earnings.  While pent-up demand will spur more leisure bookings later this year, United declined to bet on a specific timetable. “I know we’ve created a fair bit of angst amongst investors by not being willing to say that we think the inflection point on demand is right around the corner, 60 days away,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said Thursday on a conference call with analysts.  “And we hope it is, but as we said from the beginning, hope is not a strategy. ”Kirby’s caution underscored the risk for airlines in the coming months as the pandemic continues to gut travel demand.  Delta stirred hopes of an imminent rebound by offering specific goal posts last week, reiterating its cash-flow outlook and telling investors that it had a “good shot” at turning a third-quarter profit as vaccines become more widely available. United slid 5. 2% to $42. 83 at 2:33 p. m.  in New York.  That was the biggest drop by far among major U. S.  airlines, which fell less sharply as President Joe Biden’s administration said it planned to require air travelers to wear masks and would enforce quarantines for passengers arriving from other countries. 2023 GoalsInstead of shorter-term markers, United touted its goal of topping pre-pandemic profit margins in 2023.  The company will eventually look back on 2020 as a crisis that enabled executives “to structurally change the airline for the better,” Kirby said. “Whether we reach an inflection point in the spring, the summer or the fall, what we know is that a recovery is coming,” he said. In the fourth quarter, United swung to an adjusted loss of $7 a share, 35 cents worse than the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  For all of 2020, United lost $27. 57 a share, the largest shortfall in its 94-year history. First-quarter operating revenue will fall as much as 70%, the company said, slightly worse than the drop of up to 65% that Delta projected.  Looking ahead, United said it has identified $1. 4 billion in permanent cost cuts, getting it more than halfway to its goal of $2 billion. ‘Inflection Point’The Chicago-based company said customers are eager to travel as Covid-19 vaccine distribution expands.  Consumers appear ready to research trips and travel later this year, said Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella. United expects leisure demand to rebound in the second half, spurred by vaccinations, while business traffic will take 18 to 24 months to recover, he said. The airline is also counting on international profits to outpace domestic performance.  Several carriers have culled large jets such as the Boeing Co.  747 and Airbus SE A380 from their schedules, and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA has scuttled its long-haul network. As a result, Nocella said, capacity is likely to lag demand in many international markets once vaccines become widespread and border restrictions ease. “We do think there is a bunch of structural change there that will lead to stronger relative performance,” he said.  “And that should benefit United more than our competitors. ”(Updates with CEO comment in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2021 Bloomberg L.

The defect, which in rare instances leads to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.

2021-01-21 20:07:08#business#11 Investing Themes For The Biden Era, According To Jim Cramer#https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-investing-themes-biden-era-200708790.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ahEnkS6nc72zmwl26eXtwA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/70dbc98bb7ae4cc251efccc2f193bab8#en#0.0#finance.yahoo.com#"Joe Biden was sworn into office Wednesday as the 46th president of the United States.  Markets across the world surged on Wednesday, with the Dow gaining more than 258 points, the S&P 500 up 1. 4% and the Nasdaq up nearly 2%. Former President Donald Trump was anti-immigration, pro-fossil fuel and hostile toward China, said CNBC ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer.  In contrast, Biden is pro-immigration, against fossil fuels and much softer on China, he said.  With a new administration in charge, the U. S.  should see a change in the speed of the coronavirus vaccine rollout, the CNBC host said.  The issue with vaccine rollout is that the federal government gave those involved in the distribution process the same amount of power in deciding what vaccines went where, Cramer said.  ""The problem is, when everyone is in charge, nobody is in charge. "" Here's what Jim Cramer says is ahead in 2021 with Biden in the White House:E-Commerce: The pandemic accelerated the growth of e-commerce, and consumers in 2021 will not slow down on ordering from the comfort of their home, Cramer said.  Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) have only just begun, he said.  Travel and Leisure: Once there is an effective vaccine distribution plan, travel will surge, helping companies like Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), cruise lines, airlines and companies like Boeing (NYSE: BA), the CNBC host said.  Digitization and Cybersecurity: With more technological advancements to come in the cloud realm, Cramer said companies like Servicenow (NYSE: NOW), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and cybersecurity companies such as Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), will all be successful plays in 2021. 5G: A massive worldwide shortage exists of semiconductors allowing for massive growth from chip makers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Intel Corp.  (NASDAQ: INTC) as well as growth from cellphone service providers including T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS). COVID-19 Stimulus: With another round of stimulus payments expected to soon be in the hands of Americans, Cramer said retailers like Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ: COST), Amazon and Target (NYSE: TGT) could see upticks in their first-quarter earnings and continued growth through the year. China: In Cramer's view, Biden is soft on China and companies that are already established in the atmosphere there like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) will benefit. Wealth Management: Last year represented a surge for wealth and asset management companies such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Cramer said. Morgan Stanley was able to capitalize on a new generation of investors who believe that picking your own stocks is a ""good way to manage your money,"" he said.  Remote work: Even with the end of the pandemic on the horizon, remote work is here to stay, Cramer said.  For the last 10 months, millions of white collar employees have worked from home, and eh said studies show that their productivity rose. Companies such as Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM), and Amazon will benefit from the creation of more elaborate home offices, he said.  Health Care: Biden doesn't have the votes in Congress to change much in regards to health care, Cramer said, adding that an effort is likely to try to make health insurance cheaper for working class Americans, boosting companies like Centene (NYSE: CNC) and Humana (NYSE: HUM). Electric Vehicles: With the Democratic Party being strong on fighting climate change, Cramer said people will start to purchase more electric vehicles. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the manufacturers merging with special acquisition companies will see unparalleled growth, he said. General Motors (NYSE: GM) could also see a strong growth year due to its investment in EV manufacturer Rivian, Cramer said.  Housing: With Biden planning on extending policies allowing more freedom for undocumented immigrants, Cramer said millions of people could get credit to buy new homes, adding that homebuilders like Pulte Group (NYSE: PHM) will see increases in demand.

In his time at the head of the US Federal Communications Commission, Pai led the agency to dismantle former chairman Tom Wheeler's strong regulation of telecom companies.  In doing so, Pai prioritized the interests and profits of companies like Comcast and AT&T over everyday people. Good riddance. As acting chair Jessica Rosenworcel steps in with the Biden administration and we wait to see what's ahead, here's a recap of Pai's worst moves over the past four years.  Let's call it a 'what not to do' for President Biden's admin.  (The good news is that Rosenworcel has already been a clear supporter of net neutrality in her time as an FCC commissioner. )#https://www.pcgamer.com/6-times-former-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-made-the-internet-worse/#qHHHHdY8l
